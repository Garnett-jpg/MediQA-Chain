# MediQA-Chain
**MediQA-Chain** is a question-answering system based on medical literature. It retrieves relevant information from PubMed abstracts and generates accurate answers based on user queries. This project integrates Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology and large language models (LLMs) to provide an efficient QA tool for the medical field.

Dementia is attributable to 12 known risk factors in 40% cases. This study aimed 
to assess the prevalence of defined risk factors among people living with 
dementia. 174 patients with dementia and caregivers were interviewed using 
semi-structured pro forma, risk factors provided by the Lancet Commission on 
Dementia (2020), and Dementia Severity Rating Scale (DSRS). The prevalence of 11 
known risk factors and associations between the risk factors and dementia 
severity were assessed. The mean age of the participants was 73.9 years (SD = 
8.34 years). The education below intermediate level was 83.3%, 17.8% had hearing 
loss, 37.9% had hypertension, 24.1% had diabetes, 25.9% and 55.2% had alcohol 
and nicotine harmful use respectively and 8% had a history of traumatic brain 
injury and obesity each. There is a substantial prevalence of risk factors among 
people living with dementia in Nepal but no associations between any of the risk 
factors and dementia severity.

OBJECTIVES: High prevalence of visceral obesity and its associated complications 
underscore the importance of accurately quantifying visceral adipose tissue 
(VAT) depots. While whole-body MRI offers comprehensive insights into adipose 
tissue distribution, it is resource-intensive. Alternatively, evaluation of 
defined single slices provides an efficient approach for estimation of total VAT 
volume. This study investigates the influence of sex-, age-, and BMI on VAT 
distribution along the craniocaudal axis and total VAT volume obtained from 
single slice versus volumetric assessment in 3D MRI and aims to identify 
age-independent locations for accurate estimation of VAT volume from single 
slice assessment.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This secondary analysis of the prospective 
population-based German National Cohort (NAKO) included 3D VIBE Dixon MRI from 
11,191 participants (screened between May 2014 and December 2016). VAT and spine 
segmentations were automatically generated using fat-selective images. 
Standardized craniocaudal VAT profiles were generated. Axial percentage of total 
VAT was used for identification of reference locations for volume estimation of 
VAT from a single slice.
RESULTS: Data from 11,036 participants (mean age, 52 ± 11 years, 5681 men) were 
analyzed. Craniocaudal VAT distribution differed qualitatively between men/women 
and with respect to age/BMI. Age-independent single slice VAT estimates 
demonstrated strong correlations with reference VAT volumes. Anatomical 
locations for accurate VAT estimation varied with sex/BMI.
CONCLUSIONS: The selection of reference locations should be different depending 
on BMI groups, with a preference for caudal shifts in location with increasing 
BMI. For women with obesity (BMI >30 kg/m2), the L1 level emerges as the optimal 
reference location.

The rapid increase in the consumption of ultra-processed foods (UPFs) has become 
a significant global public health concern. UPFs are typically high in unhealthy 
fats, refined sugars, sodium, and other additives while being low in proteins, 
fibers, and other essential nutrients. Their high glycemic index and glycemic 
load lead to blood sugar spikes, contributing to metabolic dysregulation. 
Emerging evidence links UPF intake to the development of the 
cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic (CKM) syndrome and a higher risk of adverse 
health outcomes, such as all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. The 
pathophysiological mechanisms likely involve chronic inflammation, oxidative 
stress, dysregulated lipid metabolism, insulin resistance, immune dysfunction, 
and gut microbiota disruption. The adverse effects are even more concerning in 
vulnerable populations, including individuals with chronic kidney disease, 
kidney failure, and the elderly. This review article explores how UPF intake 
contributes to chronic diseases across the CKM spectrum, including 
cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, obesity, and type 2 diabetes mellitus, 
while also exacerbating frailty and reducing quality of life. The focus goes 
beyond risks of individual metabolic complications to address the broader health 
implications of UPFs on the increased prevalence of multiple coexistent 
non-communicable diseases, frailty, reduced quality of life, meta-inflammation, 
metabolic memory, and syndemics, which are particularly critical for the aging 
geriatric population.

Magnolol, a compound extracted from Magnolia officinalis, demonstrates potential 
efficacy in addressing metabolic dysfunction and cardiovascular diseases. Its 
biological activities encompass anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anticoagulant, 
and anti-diabetic effects. Growth/differentiation factor-15 (GDF-15), a member 
of the transforming growth factor β superfamily, is considered a potential 
therapeutic target for metabolic disorders. This study investigated the impact 
of magnolol on GDF-15 production and its underlying mechanism. The research 
examined the pharmacological effect of magnolol on GDF-15 expression in vitro 
and in vivo, and determined the involvement of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress 
signaling in this process. Luciferase reporter assays, chromatin 
immunoprecipitation, and in vitro DNA binding assays were employed to examine 
the regulation of GDF-15 by activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), CCAAT 
enhancer binding protein γ (CEBPG), and CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF). The study 
also investigated the effect of magnolol and ATF4 on the activity of a putative 
enhancer located in the intron of the GDF-15 gene, as well as the influence of 
single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on magnolol and ATF4-induced 
transcription activity. Results demonstrated that magnolol triggers GDF-15 
production in endothelial cells (ECs), hepatoma cell line G2 (HepG2) and 
hepatoma cell line 3B (Hep3B) cell lines, and primary mouse hepatocytes. The 
cooperative binding of ATF4 and CEBPG upstream of the GDF-15 gene or the 
E1944285 enhancer located in the intron led to full-power transcription of the 
GDF-15 gene. SNP alleles were found to impact the magnolol and ATF4-induced 
transcription activity of GDF-15. In high-fat diet ApoE-/- mice, administration 
of magnolol induced GDF-15 production and partially suppressed appetite through 
GDF-15. These findings suggest that magnolol regulates GDF-15 expression through 
priming of promoter and enhancer activity, indicating its potential as a drug 
for the treatment of metabolic disorders.

Aralia taibaiensi, widely distributed in western China, particularly in the 
Qinba Mountains, has been utilized as a folk medicine for treating diabetes, 
gastropathy, rheumatism, and cardiovascular diseases. Saponins from A. 
taibaiensis (sAT) have demonstrated protective effects against oxidative stress 
and mitochondrial dysfunction induced by ischemia/reperfusion (I/R). However, 
the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In vivo, middle cerebral artery 
occlusion/reperfusion (MCAO/R) induced inflammatory infiltration, neuronal 
injury, cell apoptosis, mitochondrial dysfunction, and oxidative stress in the 
ischaemic penumbra, which were effectively mitigated by sAT. sAT increased the 
mRNA and protein expression levels of apelin and its receptor apelin/apelin 
receptors (ARs) both in vivo and in vitro. (Ala13)-Apelin-13 (F13A) and small 
interfering RNA (siRNA) abolished the regulatory effects of sAT on 
neuroprotection mediated by adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein 
kinase (AMPK)/protein kinase B (Akt). Furthermore, sAT induced apelin/AR 
expression by simultaneously inhibiting P38 mitogen-activated protein kinase 
(P38 MAPK)/activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) and upregulating 
hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α). Our findings indicate that sAT regulates 
apelin/AR/AMPK by inhibiting P38 MAPK/ATF4 and upregulating HIF-1a, thereby 
suppressing oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction.

OBJECTIVE: Asthma and type 2 diabetes are two important causes of morbidity 
globally. We examined both the association of type 2 diabetes with asthma in 
Swedish adults and the familial co-aggregation of the diseases.
METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study of all adults aged 25-85 in Sweden 
between 2009 and 2013. Asthma and type 2 diabetes status were ascertained from 
the health registers. Models were adjusted for sex, age, education level, income 
and country of birth and in a subset, for body mass index (BMI). We further 
conducted a familial coaggregation analysis to determine if shared familial 
factors could explain any observed findings.
RESULTS: The study included 5 299 245 participants, 25 292 (0.5%) had both 
asthma and type 2 diabetes. In the total population, the OR for the association 
between type 2 diabetes and asthma was 1.47 (95% CI 1.45 to 1.49); in the 
population of men (1.30 (95% CI 1.27 to 1.32)) and women (1.63 (95% CI 1.60 to 
1.66)). The ORs were slightly higher among men (1.51 (95% CI 1.45 to 1.56)) and 
women (2.04 (95% CI 1.96 to 2.11)) for whom BMI measurements were available but 
attenuated with adjustment for BMI (1.45 (95% CI 1.40 to 1.51)) and (1.76 (95% 
CI 1.68 to 1.84)). Diabetes was more likely if a full sibling had asthma than if 
the sibling did not (1.13 (95% CI 1.10 to 1.15)).
CONCLUSIONS: We found an association between asthma and type 2 diabetes that was 
sustained after adjusting for BMI, indicating that BMI alone does not explain 
this relationship. We also found that the two conditions coaggregate in 
siblings, indicating that the association is partly due to shared familial 
genetic and environmental risk factors.

AIM: Rural communities are under-represented in diabetes research, with 
implications for the generalisability, implementation and reach of research 
outcomes. Increased efforts to conduct diabetes research in, or inclusive of, 
rural communities are predicated on effective participant recruitment. This 
study explores the motivations for, barriers to and enablers of research 
participation among adults with type 2 diabetes (T2D) in Australian rural 
communities.
METHOD: A phenomenological qualitative study was conducted involving adults 
(18+ years) living with T2D in rural communities, using multi-modal recruitment 
approaches and purposeful sampling across Australian states and gender. 
Audio-recorded, semi-structured interviews explored participants' perceptions of 
research participation. An abductive coding approach was undertaken to identify 
salient themes.
RESULTS: Twenty-one participants were recruited across all six Australian 
states, median (range) age of 63 (41-78) years and 65% were women. Barriers to 
research participation include diabetes stigma, lack of community awareness of 
T2D, few research opportunities, geographical distances of rural communities 
from research sites and individual time and resource constraints. Enablers 
strongly focused on increased engagement and involvement of rural communities in 
research and offering education or access to diabetes care as part of research 
activities. Motivations for research participation included opportunities to 
help or advocate for rural and T2D communities and highlight under-resourcing of 
rural healthcare services.
CONCLUSION: Study findings inform practical strategies that may improve 
recruitment mechanisms for T2D research in rural communities, for example, 
community-driven recruitment methods. Evaluation of the effectiveness of such 
strategies in research practice will be needed.

BACKGROUND: Pulmonary hypertension affects patients with hemodialysis-dependent 
end-stage kidney failure; however, the estimated prevalence varies greatly due 
to the underutilization of right heart catheterization and the evolving 
diagnostic criteria of pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary hypertension in 
end-stage kidney failure is often attributed to arteriovenous (AV) access; 
therefore, we hypothesized that patients with AV fistula/graft would have a 
greater prevalence of pulmonary hypertension on right heart catheterization 
compared to those with central venous (CV) catheter accesses.
METHODS: In this retrospective single-center cohort study, we identified and 
randomly sampled patients from July 2012 to August 2022 receiving hemodialysis 
for ≥ 3 months and who underwent right heart catheterization, using Current 
Procedural Terminology codes. Pulmonary hypertension was defined as mean 
pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP) > 20 mmHg. Our primary outcome was the 
prevalence of pulmonary hypertension among patients with AV fistula/graft versus 
CV hemodialysis access, tested with descriptive statistics. We evaluated 
survival as a secondary outcome using a Cox proportional hazards model.
RESULTS: A total of 3834 patient charts were extracted. Overall, 444 charts were 
randomly sampled, resulting in 137 subjects meeting the inclusion criteria. The 
mean age was 63.8 ± 10.5 years, and 62% were male. The most common etiology of 
end-stage kidney failure was diabetic kidney disease (57.7%). Eighty percent of 
end-stage kidney failure patients had pulmonary hypertension; however, the type 
of hemodialysis access was not associated with pulmonary hypertension (85% CV 
catheter vs. 79.5% AV access, p = 0.59). Patients with pulmonary hypertension 
had lower hemoglobin (9.6 ± 0.8 vs. 11.2 ± 1.3 g/dL, p < 0.0001) and serum 
albumin (2.3 ± 0.9 vs. 3.4 ± 0.6 g/dL, p < 0.0001) than those without pulmonary 
hypertension. Those with pulmonary hypertension had an increased risk of 
mortality (hazard ratio: 2.2, 95% confidence interval: 1.04-4.61; p = 0.04).
CONCLUSION: Our findings show a high burden of pulmonary hypertension among this 
heterogeneous cohort of end-stage kidney failure patients, with no association 
between pulmonary hypertension and the type of hemodialysis access. This study 
highlights the need for prospective investigations incorporating current 
strategies for pulmonary hypertension diagnosis and treatment among the 
dialysis-dependent population.

OBJECTIVE: To compare different doses and dosing regimens of RC28-E, a novel 
bispecific antibody that simultaneously binds vascular endothelial growth 
factor-A (VEGF-A) and fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2), with conbercept in 
patients with diabetic macular edema (DME).
DESIGN: Prospective, randomised, active comparator-controlled, open-label, 
multicentre, phase 2 clinical trial.cente PARTICIPANTS: The trial enrolled 
patients aged 18 years or older with centre-involving DME, best-corrected visual 
acuity (BCVA) of 73 to 24 Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) 
letters, and central subfield thickness (CST) of 300 µm or more.
METHODS: Patients were assigned randomly to one of five treatment regimens: 
1.0 mg RC28-E for three initial monthly doses and then every 8 weeks (1.0mgQ8); 
1.0 mg RC28-E for five initial monthly doses and then on a pro re nata (PRN) 
basis (1.0mgPRN); 2.0 mg RC28-E for three initial monthly doses and then every 8 
weeks (2.0mgQ8); 2.0 mg RC28-E for five initial monthly doses and then on a PRN 
basis (2.0mgPRN); or 0.5 mg conbercept for three initial monthly doses and then 
on a PRN basis. Assessments were made at baseline and every 4 weeks thereafter.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary endpoint was the change in BCVA compared with 
baseline at 24 and 52 weeks. Secondary endpoints included the change in CST from 
baseline at 52 weeks; the proportion of patients who gained/lost ≥15 letters, 
≥10 letters and >0 letter in BCVA; and the number of injections and safety 
outcomes.
RESULTS: The trial enrolled 156 patients. Mean improvements in BCVA in the 
RC28-E groups at week 24 were 7.1, 11.0, 7.4 and 10.5 letters for 1.0mgQ8, 
1.0mgPRN, 2.0mgQ8 and 2.0mgPRN regimens, respectively, versus 9.7 letters for 
the conbercept group (p=0.146). By week 52, the RC28-E groups exhibited 
respective mean BCVA enhancements of 5.5, 9.5, 9.2 and 9.7 letters, compared 
with 8.4 letters of the conbercept group (p=0.469). Mean reductions in CST in 
the RC28-E groups at week 52 were -163.2 µm, -136.9 µm, -142.5 µm and -153.6 µm, 
versus -160.7 µm for the conbercept group (p=0.948). The Per Protocol Set 
analysis indicated that at 24 weeks, the BCVA improvement in the 2.0mgPRN group 
was significantly greater than that in the conbercept group (14.0 vs 9.8, 
p=0.019). In patients with poor baseline glycaemic control (HbA1c ≥7.5%), the 
2.0mgPRN group showed greater BCVA improvement than the conbercept group (14.4 
vs 4.2, p=0.039) at week 52. During the maintenance phase, the 2.0mgPRN group 
had fewer injections (2.8, 95% CI 1.8 to 3.7) compared with the conbercept group 
(4.4, 95% CI 3.5 to 5.2). RC28-E was generally well tolerated. The incidence of 
ocular adverse events in study eyes was comparable between RC28-E groups (22.6% 
in 1.0mgQ8 group, 26.7% in 1.0mgPRN group, 34.4% in 2.0mgQ8 group, 25.0% in 
2.0 mg PRN group) and conbercept group (32.3%). The number of ocular serious 
adverse events was 1 (1.0mgQ8), 0 (1.0mgPRN), 1 (2.0mgQ8), 2 (2.0mgPRN) and 0 
(conbercept).
CONCLUSIONS: Intravitreous RC28-E improved BCVA and CST in eyes with 
centre-involved DME. Compared with conbercept, the 2.0mgPRN regimen of RC28-E 
was recommended due to its superior efficacy in improving vision particularly 
for patients with poor glycaemic control, fewer treatment injections during the 
maintenance phase and comparable safety profile.

OBJECTIVE: Historical reductions in cardiovascular disease (CVD) due to 
lifestyle and treatment improvements are now threatened by factors such as 
increasing obesity and diabetes, but the relative importance of different risk 
factors varies by CVD condition. This study describes secular trends in CVD 
events by individual condition from 2012 to 2022.
METHODS: In a cohort of 452 094 Greater Glasgow and Clyde residents aged ≥51 
years, linked hospital admission and death data were used to ascertain total 
annual events for ischaemic heart disease (IHD), myocardial infarction (MI), 
heart failure (HF), atrial fibrillation (AF), stroke, abdominal aortic aneurysm 
(AAA) and peripheral artery disease (PAD). Poisson regressions with robust 
standard errors were used to examine the relative change in event rates over 
time, overall and by subgroup.
RESULTS: Overall, the event rate ratios (RRs) for IHD, MI, AF and AAA all fell 
between 2012 and 2021 after adjustment for age, sex and deprivation. However, on 
subgroup analysis, the RRs increased between 2012 and 2022 among those aged 
51-64 years for HF (RR 1.5), stroke (RR 1.4) and PAD (RR 1.8).
CONCLUSIONS: Overall declines in most types of CVD mask an increasing burden of 
events relating to HF, stroke and PAD among individuals aged 51-64 years.

PURPOSE: Initiated in 2010, the Genetics of Glucose regulation in Gestation and 
Growth (Gen3G) prospective cohort investigates the pathophysiology of impaired 
glycaemic regulation in pregnancy and evaluates its impact on both the mothers 
and her offspring health trajectory. Follow-up visits 3 and 5 years after 
delivery aimed to investigate pregnancy-related risk factors such as maternal 
obesity and gestational hyperglycaemia in relation to the mother's metabolic 
health after pregnancy, and with offspring health outcomes such as risk of 
obesity and neurodevelopmental problems in early childhood. We also investigated 
molecular mechanisms involved in the fetal programming of these later health 
outcomes.
PARTICIPANTS: Of the 1024 women originally recruited in the first trimester of 
pregnancy, we have targeted the 854 who had complete glucose tolerance test data 
and the 724 newborns who provided placenta and/or cord blood samples for 
follow-up recruitment. Of these, 695 mother-child dyads agreed to be contacted 
for the prospective follow-up visits. 448 and 521 mother-child dyads completed 
the research visits at 3 and 5 years after delivery respectively.
FINDINGS TO DATE: At both visits, we collected the mother's and child's medical 
history, lifestyle (using validated questionnaires), sociodemographic status, 
anthropometric measurements, mother's blood samples, child's saliva samples and 
growth charts. At the 5-year-old visit, we additionally collected the mother's 
and child's urine and stool samples and the child's blood samples; we performed 
a 75 g oral glucose tolerance test in the mothers and assessed the body 
composition in children using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Using the Gen3G 
rich longitudinal data set, we have enhanced the understanding of the 
pathophysiology and characterisation of the heterogeneity of gestational 
diabetes mellitus, and we have shown that gestational hyperglycaemia and insulin 
resistance are associated with offspring epigenetics (DNA methylation) 
variations in the placenta, cord blood and blood at 5 years of age, as well as 
with offspring anthropometric, metabolic and neurodevelopmental outcomes in 
early childhood.
FUTURE PLANS: We are currently conducting a prospective follow-up of mothers and 
their children 12 years after delivery to study how prenatal and early-life 
metabolic factors may programme childhood adiposity and obesogenic dietary 
behaviours. This follow-up should be completed by the end of 2026.

BACKGROUND: Delayed graft function (DGF) continues to represent one of the most 
frequently encountered early complications following kidney transplantation. 
Despite notable progress in donor and recipient pretreatment protocols, 
diagnostic techniques and therapeutic approaches, the incidence of DGF, along 
with its associated short- and long-term sequelae, has not demonstrated a 
significant reduction. DGF is influenced by a multitude of factors, and 
individuals with exposure to these risk factors exhibit a markedly increased 
probability of developing DGF.
OBJECTIVES: To systematically identify and evaluate risk factors associated with 
DGF in kidney transplant recipients.
DESIGN: A systematic review and meta-analysis DATA SOURCES: A comprehensive 
search was performed across multiple databases, including PubMed, Embase, The 
Cochrane Library, Web of Science, CNKI, Wanfang, VIP and SinoMed, from the 
inception of each database until 1 March 2024.
PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: OR and OR 95% CI of risk factors for DGF.
RESULTS: The meta-analysis included 19 studies involving a total of 153 008 
patients, of whom 96 596 (63.1%) developed DGF. The following risk factors for 
DGF were identified: prolonged cold ischaemia time (CIT) (OR=1.05, 95% CI=1.03 
to 1.07, p<0.0001), elevated donor end-stage serum creatinine (OR=1.54, 95% 
CI=1.26 to 1.87, p<0.0001), extended dialysis vintage (OR=1.02, 95% CI=1.00 to 
1.02, p=0.014), increased human leucocyte antigen (HLA) mismatch number 
(OR=1.19, 95% CI=1.06 to 1.33, p=0.004), higher donor body mass index (BMI) 
(OR=1.07, 95% CI=1.03 to 1.11, p<0.0001), advanced donor age (OR=1.02, 95% 
CI=1.01 to 1.03, p=0.003) and recipient diabetes mellitus (OR=1.52, 95% CI=1.40 
to 1.64, p<0.0001).
CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis identified seven significant risk factors for 
DGF, including prolonged CIT, elevated donor end-stage serum creatinine, 
extended dialysis vintage, increased HLA mismatch number, higher donor BMI, 
advanced donor age and recipient diabetes mellitus. These findings may offer 
potential insights for developing clinical strategies to mitigate the risk of 
DGF in kidney transplant recipients and improve postoperative management.

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to compare the performance of five machine learning 
algorithms to predict diabetes mellitus based on lifestyle factors (diet and 
physical activity).
DESIGN: Retrospective cross-sectional predictive modelling study.
SETTING: This study was conducted using publicly available data from the 
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), a nationally 
representative survey designed to assess the health and nutritional status of 
the US population.
PARTICIPANTS: We analysed data from 29 509 non-pregnant adults who participated 
in NHANES between 2007 and 2018.
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was the prediction 
of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) by self-reported responses based on machine 
learning models. The performance of five machine learning algorithms (logistic 
regression, support vector machine, random forest, XGBoost and CatBoost) was 
evaluated using accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, 
negative predictive value, and the area under the receiver operating 
characteristic curve (AUC). The secondary outcome measures were feature 
importance and model performance comparison.
RESULTS: XGBoost exhibited the highest overall predictive performance (AUC 
0.8168), followed by random forest and logistic regression (AUCs around 0.79). 
In terms of accuracy, logistic regression, XGBoost and random forest performed 
similarly at approximately 85%. While most models demonstrated high specificity 
(>97%), the SVM stood out for having the highest sensitivity (58.57%), although 
with a lower accuracy (62.44%). This trade-off underscores the strength of SVM 
in identifying more true-positive cases, though at the cost of lower overall 
classification precision. The random forest model, despite having lower 
sensitivity (7.15%), provided one of the most balanced performances in terms of 
specificity and interpretability.
CONCLUSION: The results support the use of machine learning models, particularly 
XGBoost, for early identification of individuals at risk for T2DM. Despite their 
limited sensitivity, the high specificity and accuracy underscore these models' 
potential for non-invasive risk assessment. This study is innovative in its 
integration of machine learning algorithms to predict type 2 diabetes based 
solely on non-invasive, easily accessible lifestyle and anthropometric 
variables, demonstrating the potential of data-driven models for early risk 
assessment without requiring laboratory tests. Despite the lower sensitivity 
observed in most models, their high specificity makes them valuable for early 
screening in clinical and public health settings, where they can be complemented 
with follow-up assessments or ensemble approaches that optimise the balance 
between sensitivity and specificity for improved risk stratification.

The glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) is a high-affinity glucose transporter that is 
predominantly expressed in the skeletal muscle, myocardium, and adipose tissue, 
and is the rate-limiting transporter of insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. 
Compounds that enhance the process of GLUT4 translocation in skeletal muscle 
would provide a novel treatment for type 2 diabetes mellitus. After a 
high-throughput screening (HTS) campaign and medicinal chemistry efforts, we 
identified the xanthene compound DS-1150b (16·tBuNH2) as a novel potent GLUT4 
translocation enhancer. DS-1150b was found to promote GLUT4 translocation in 
L6-myotubes in rats and showed a glucose-lowering effect in an oral glucose 
tolerance test (oGTT) in a Zucker fatty rat model. Identification of naphthalene 
analog DS20060511 is also briefly described.

Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinases (PDHKs) are non-canonical serine/threonine 
kinases that regulate the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. Given their central 
role in metabolism, dysregulation of PDHKs has been linked with a broad variety 
of pathological conditions, such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, lactic 
acidosis, and cancer. While there are many small molecule PDHK inhibitors, 
including several that have advanced into clinical development, no PDHK 
inhibitor has been approved for therapeutic use for any indication. Currently 
the field lacks well-characterized tool compounds that can probe PDHK biology 
and differentiate between PDHK isoforms. Moreover, disconnects between 
biochemical and cell-based assays have complicated efforts to understand the 
biological effect of inhibiting PDHK catalytic activity. To better understand 
how PDHK inhibitors function in cells, we have developed a cell-based assay 
using NanoBRET Target Engagement technology. Here, we describe the use of 
NanoBRET to evaluate binding at the PDHK ATP and lipoamide sites. Using these 
assays, we have profiled previously described PDHK inhibitors and demonstrated 
the ability of NanoBRET to distinguish between PDHK inhibitors with different 
mechanisms of action and to elucidate isoform selectivity.

PURPOSE: To determine the contemporary annual incidence rates of hospitalization 
for diabetes-related foot complication (DFC) and lower-extremity amputation in 
Canada.
METHODS: The study timeframe was April 2011 to March 2022. The population was 
persons at least 20 years old in all of Canada except Québec. From the Canadian 
Institute for Health Information's Discharge Abstract Database of acute care 
hospitalizations, a person's (i) first DFC, (ii) first diabetes-related major 
amputation, and (iii) first diabetes-related major or minor amputation were 
identified. Using population data from Statistics Canada, age- and sex-adjusted 
annual rates were calculated for each of these events. Regression models for 
temporal trends in these rates were fitted for the full population and by 
province or territory.
RESULTS: Over the 11-year study period, there were 20,886 first major 
amputations, 41,643 first major or minor amputations, and 48,526 first DFC. The 
average incidence rates across years for major amputation, major or minor 
amputation, and DFC were 8.8, 17.5, and 20.3 per 100,000 population 
respectively. The major amputation rate decreased over time (-0.06 per year [95% 
CI -0.11 to -0.01]), but there was no change over time for other events. A 
declining rate of major amputation was only observed in Ontario, Manitoba, and 
Saskatchewan, but not in other provinces or territories.
CONCLUSION: The national rate of major amputation related to diabetes has 
decreased, but the burden of DFC requiring hospitalization has not. These 
contemporary data support the need to strengthen foot screening and limb 
preservation efforts for people living with diabetes across Canada.

Immune-mediated beta-cell destruction and lack of alpha-cell responsiveness to 
hypoglycaemia are hallmarks of type 1 diabetes pathology. The incretin hormone 
glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) may hold therapeutic 
potential for type 1 diabetes due to its insulinotropic and glucagonotropic 
effects, as well as its cytoprotective effects shown in rodent beta cells. To 
further increase our understanding of GIP's effects on human beta cells, we here 
examined the functional, protective, and transcriptomic effects of GIP in human 
EndoC-βH5 beta cells and isolated human islets in the presence or absence of 
proinflammatory cytokines (interferon (IFN)-γ ± interleukin (IL)-1β) as a mimic 
of type 1 diabetes. GIP dose-dependently augmented glucose-stimulated insulin 
secretion from EndoC-βH5 cells and increased insulin and glucagon secretion from 
human islets at high and low glucose concentrations, respectively. The 
insulinotropic effect of GIP in EndoC-βH5 cells was abrogated by KN-93, an 
inhibitor of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase 2 (CaMK2). GIP did not 
prevent cytokine-induced apoptosis in EndoC-βH5 cells or human islets, and GIP 
did not protect against cytokine-induced functional impairment in EndoC-βH5 
cells. GIP treatment of human islets for 24 hours had no effects on the 
transcriptome and did not modulate cytokine-induced transcriptional changes. 
However, GIP augmented IL-1β + IFNγ-induced secretion of interleukin (IL)-10 and 
c-c motif chemokine ligand (CCL)-2 from human islets while decreasing the 
secretion of c-x-c motif chemokine ligand (CXCL)-8. In EndoC-βH5 cells, GIP 
reduced IFN-γ-induced secretion of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, IL-2, IL-6, 
and IL-10 but increased the secretion of CXCL8, CCL2, CCL4, and CCL11. In 
conclusion, our results suggest that the insulinotropic effect of GIP is 
CaMK2-dependent. Furthermore, our findings indicate that GIP neither exerts 
cytoprotective effects against cytokines nor modulate the transcriptome of human 
islets. GIP may, however, exert selective modulatory effects on secreted 
inflammatory factors from cytokine-exposed beta cells and islets.

Pregnancy requires the coordination of metabolically active organs to support 
maternal nutrition and fetal growth. However, the metabolic cross-talk between 
adipose tissue and liver in females during pregnancy is still less clear. In 
this study, we evaluated the metabolic adaptations and phenotypes of liver in 
response to pregnancy-associated metabolic stress, particularly in the context 
of genetic ablation of Uncoupling protein 1 (Ucp1)-mediated catabolic circuit. 
Our results revealed that Ucp1 deficiency (UCP1 knockout, KO) mice during late 
pregnancy exhibited significantly deteriorated metabolic phenotypes, including 
hepatic steatosis and whole-body glucose and lipid homeostasis, as compared to 
Ucp1 deficiency or normal pregnancy mice. However, non-pregnant Ucp1 deficiency 
mice displayed nearly normal metabolic phenotypes and structure alterations 
similar to those of littermate controls. Moreover, transcriptomic analyses by 
RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) clearly revealed that Ucp1 deficiency led to a 
significant liver metabolic remodeling of differentially express genes (DEGs) 
before and especially during pregnancy. Consistently, Gene Ontology (GO) and 
Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses demonstrated the 
potential altered functions and signaling pathways, including metabolic 
dysfunctions in ribosome, oxidative phosphorylation, etc. Importantly, as 
derived from trend analyses of DEGs, our results further revealed the distinct 
expression pattern of each subcluster, which coincided with potential biological 
functions and relevant signaling pathways. The findings in the present study 
might provide valuable insights into the molecular mechanism of metabolic 
dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) during pregnancy. 
Additionally, our data may provide a novel animal model of MAFLD, thus 
facilitating its potential therapies. NEW & NOTEWORTHY: Genetic ablation of Ucp1 
during pregnancy increases hepatic steatosis and deteriorated whole-body glucose 
and lipid homeostasis. Moreover, changes in hepatic gene expression are closely 
associated with metabolic dysfunctions in ribosome and oxidative 
phosphorylation. This work highlights the therapeutic potential of targeting 
UCP1- mediated catabolic circuit between adipose and liver during pregnancy, and 
the utility of RNA-seq analysis to reveal valuable information for the distinct 
expression pattern of each subcluster that contribute to pregnancy-dependent 
MASLD progression.

PURPOSE: To evaluate whether pre-operative glycemic control is predictive of 
acute endophthalmitis after cataract surgery.
DESIGN: Retrospective case-control study.
SUBJECTS: Patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) who underwent cataract surgery in 
2010-2022 in the US Veterans Affairs (VA) Health Care System.
METHODS: Data extracted from the VA Corporate Data Warehouse included patient 
demographics, clinical features, timing of DM diagnosis, and pre-operative 
hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels drawn 0-6 months before surgery. Acute 
post-operative endophthalmitis cases were identified using Current Procedural 
Terminology and International Classification of Diseases codes, then confirmed 
by chart review. Univariable and multivariable analyses were used to test for an 
association between pre-operative HbA1c and the development of post-operative 
endophthalmitis.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Development of post-operative endophthalmitis within 42 
days after cataract surgery.
RESULTS: Of 190 393 patients with a diagnosis of DM at the time of cataract 
surgery and HbA1c recorded 0-6 months prior to surgery, 157 (0.08%) developed 
acute post-operative endophthalmitis. Mean ± standard deviation pre-operative 
HbA1c was lower in patients with acute post-operative endophthalmitis (7.1 ± 
1.4%) than in controls without endophthalmitis (7.3 ± 1.5%) but this difference 
was not significant (P = 0.14). Similarly, subanalysis of the cohort with HbA1c 
levels drawn 0-2 months before surgery showed no association between 
pre-operative HbA1c and endophthalmitis (P = 0.31). Multiple logistic regression 
analysis also showed no association between pre-operative glycemic control as 
measured by HbA1c and post-operative endophthalmitis (adjusted odds ratio, 0.89; 
95% confidence interval, 0.79 - 1.01; P = 0.08).
CONCLUSIONS: Pre-operative HbA1c level was not associated with the development 
of acute post-operative endophthalmitis in patients with DM undergoing cataract 
surgery. These findings suggest that pre-operative HbA1c guidelines based on 
infection rates after non-ophthalmic surgery may not apply to cataract surgery.

Mitochondria, as central regulators of cellular processes such as energy 
production, apoptosis, and metabolic homeostasis, are essential to cellular 
function and health. The maintenance of mitochondrial integrity, especially 
through mitophagy-the selective removal of impaired mitochondria-is crucial for 
cellular homeostasis. Dysregulation of mitochondrial function, dynamics, and 
biogenesis is linked to neurodegenerative and metabolic diseases, notably 
Alzheimer's disease, which is increasingly recognized as a metabolic disorder 
due to its shared pathophysiologic features: insulin resistance, oxidative 
stress, and chronic inflammation. In this review, we highlight recent 
advancements in pharmacological interventions, focusing on agents that modulate 
mitophagy, mitochondrial uncouplers that reduce oxidative phosphorylation, 
compounds that directly scavenge reactive oxygen species to alleviate oxidative 
stress, and molecules that ameliorate amyloid beta plaque accumulation and 
phosphorylated tau pathology. Additionally, we explore dietary and lifestyle 
interventions-MIND and ketogenic diets, caloric restriction, physical activity, 
hormone modulation, and stress management-that complement pharmacological 
approaches and support mitochondrial health. Our review underscores 
mitochondria's central role in the pathogenesis and potential treatment of 
neurodegenerative and metabolic diseases, particularly AD. By advocating for an 
integrated therapeutic model that combines pharmacological and lifestyle 
interventions, we propose a comprehensive approach aimed at mitigating 
mitochondrial dysfunction and improving clinical outcomes in these complex, 
interrelated diseases.

Type 2 diabetes is a major contributor to the burden of chronic diseases 
globally. Most cases of type 2 diabetes are preventable through healthy 
lifestyle modifications in diet and physical activity. This systematic umbrella 
review presents a comprehensive overview of the evidence about the associations 
between the risk of type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome with thirteen food 
groups, including refined and whole grains, fruits, vegetables, nuts, legumes, 
fish and fish products, eggs, dairy/milk, sugar-sweetened beverages, processed 
meat, unprocessed red and white meat. We present these relationships in per 
serving and with high versus low comparisons. After doing a systematic search in 
Medline, Embase, Web of Science, and Epistemonikos (registered in PROSPERO: 
CRD42024547606), we screened 5,074 references published until May 15, 2024, and 
included 67 articles. This included 46 meta-analyses on the risk of type 2 
diabetes with half a million participants, 17 meta-analyses on the risk of 
metabolic syndrome, and 4 meta-analyses on the risk of diabetes-related 
mortality. Based on quality assessments using AMSTAR-2, 25 of the 67 studies 
were classified as high-quality studies, 8 as moderate, 12 as low, and 22 as 
critically low quality. Our results showed that a high intake of whole grains 
was associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes (meta-evidence: moderate) 
and metabolic syndrome (meta-evidence: low), with a similar tendency also for a 
high intake of fruits and vegetables (meta-evidence: moderate). In contrast, the 
high intakes of processed meat (meta-evidence: high), red meat (meta-evidence: 
moderate), and sugar-sweetened beverages (meta-evidence: moderate) were 
associated with a higher risk of type 2 diabetes. For the other food groups, the 
associations were more or less neutral and not statistically significant. The 
heterogeneity was high for most food groups except fruits, indicating potential 
differences within each of the food groups in association with type 2 diabetes.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the dose-response relationship between dietary sugar 
and T2D risk.
METHODS: MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science and Cochrane databases were 
searched through July 9, 2024 for prospective cohorts reporting relative 
measures of incident T2D risk by categories of dietary sugar (total, free, 
added, fructose, sucrose) or two beverage sources (non-diet SSB, fruit juice) in 
healthy adults (Prospero ID: CRD42023401800). Linear and restricted cubic spline 
dose-response models were fitted for each exposure and study-specific slopes and 
confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. Heterogeneity was evaluated using 
Q-statistics. Risk of bias was evaluated using ROBINS-E tool GRADE approach was 
applied to assess the certainty of evidence.
RESULTS: Of 10,384 studies, 29 cohorts were included: SSB:18 (n = 541,288); 
fruit juice:14 (n = 490,413); sucrose: 7 (n = 223,238); total sugar: 4 (n = 
109,858); fructose: 5 (n = 158,136); and added sugar: 2 (n = 31,004). Studies 
were conducted in Europe (13), USA (11), Asia (6), Australia (4), and Latin 
America (3). Each additional serving of SSB and fruit juice was associated with 
a higher risk of T2D (RR: 1.25; 95% CI: 1.17-1.35 and RR: 1.05; 95% CI: 
>1.00-1.11, respectively; moderate certainty). In contrast, 20 g/d intakes of 
total sugar and sucrose were inversely associated with T2D (RR: 0.96; 95% CI: 
0.94-0.98; low certainty; and RR: 0.95; 95% CI: 0.91- <1.00; moderate certainty, 
respectively). No associations for added sugar (RR: 0.99; 95% CI: 0.96-1.01; low 
certainty) or fructose (RR: 0.98; 95% CI: 0.83-1.15; very low certainty).
CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that dietary sugar consumed as a beverage 
(SSB and fruit juice) is associated with incident T2D risk. The results do not 
support the common assumption that dietary sugar (i.e., total sugar and 
sucrose), irrespective of type and amount, is consistently associated with 
increased T2D risk.
STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: This study is the first to comprehensively establish 
a dose-response relationship between dietary sugar intake and T2D risk, showing 
that sugar from beverages (SSBs and fruit juice) increases risk, while total 
sugar, sucrose, fructose and added sugar exhibit inverse or null associations. 
These findings challenge the assumption that all sugars uniformly elevate T2D 
risk.

To obtain a profound understanding of microbiome variations and their 
associations with diabetic cornea wound healing, a type 1 diabetic mouse model 
and a corneal epithelial wound healing model were established. Corneal tissues 
from diabetic mice and healthy controls were collected. The 2bRAD sequencing for 
microbiome (2bRAD-M)technique was used to analyze the ocular microbiome 
profiles. Fifty-five distinct bacterial species were identified through 
alignment against the 2bRAD-M database. Among all the species identified on the 
corneal wound, 17 (30.91%) unique species were discovered on the diabetic 
epithelium side, 13 (23.64%) on the non-diabetic epithelium side, and 25 
(45.45%) species were common to both. The top five most abundant bacterial 
species on the non-diabetic side were Exiguobacterium sibiricum (26.50%), 
Enterobacter hormaechei (13.37%), Brevibacillus agri (6.24%), Ralstonia sp. 
UNC404CL21Col (6.11%), and Cupriavidus pauculus (5.71%). On the diabetic side, 
the predominant five species were Methylobacterium sp. MB200 (38.73%), 
Exiguobacterium sibiricum (11.58%), Acinetobacter johnsonii (9.80%), 
Corynebacterium glutamicum (6.46%), and Corynebacterium stationis (5.71%). 
Increased levels of gram-negative bacilli, such as Methylobacterium, in the 
diabetic ocular surface microbiota may be involved in the delayed healing of 
corneal wounds. Gatifloxacin eye drops with antibacterial activity against 
gram-negative bacteria were applied to the ocular surface. The corneal 
epithelium of diabetic mice healed more rapidly after the application of 
gatifloxacin eye drops. The changes in the ocular surface microbiota of diabetic 
corneal wounds may be related to delayed healing of the corneal epithelium in 
diabetic mice, providing a new research target for the investigation of this 
pathology.

BACKGROUND: Assessing a patient's catabolism in clinical practice is challenging 
but could help guide nutritional interventions. The urea-to-creatinine ratio 
(UCR) reflects muscle breakdown and protein metabolism and has been associated 
with risk for overfeeding and adverse outcomes in the critical care setting. We 
validated this concept in a well-characterized population of medical ward 
patients from a previous nutritional trial.
METHODS: This secondary analysis of the Effect of Early Nutritional Support on 
Frailty, Functional Outcomes, and Recovery of Malnourished Medical Inpatients 
Trial (EFFORT) examined baseline UCR and changes during follow-up in medical 
inpatients at risk for malnutrition. A catabolic state was defined as a high 
baseline UCR or an increase in UCR over 7 days. The primary endpoint was 
mortality at 30 days.
RESULTS: We included 1,595 of 2,028 EFFORT patients with baseline UCR 
measurements and 870 who also had UCR measurements on day 7. A high baseline 
UCR, as well as an increase in UCR over 7 days, were associated with increased 
mortality (adjusted HR for 30-day mortality 2.05 (1.47 to 2.87) p<0.001 and 2.02 
(1.34 to 3.06) p=0.001). There was no difference in treatment response when 
stratifying patients based on baseline or follow-up UCR.
CONCLUSION: Assessment of catabolism through UCR measurement at baseline and 
changes during follow-up was associated with increased mortality and adverse 
outcomes in medical inpatients at nutritional risk. However, this stratification 
was not associated with response to nutritional therapy in our sample. Further 
studies into the dynamic changes in UCR are needed to better understand the 
clinical implications for medical ward patients.

BACKGROUND: 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) is the principal biomarker of vitamin D 
status. Values below the assay detection limit (<10 nmol/L) are often reported 
as missing. Thus the most severely deficient participants are excluded from 
research which can lead to inaccurate findings such as underestimated prevalence 
of deficiency, overlooked risk factors, and biased evaluation of disease 
associations.
METHODS: In total 369,626 individuals from the UK Biobank cohort were included 
in this study. Data on 25OHD concentration and relevant demographic and 
lifestyle factors such as age, supplement intake, diet, and time spent outdoors 
were used in the analyses. Ambient UVB radiation was approximated for each 
participant. 25OHD was evaluated as a categorical outcome and we reintroduced 
participants with 25OHD values <10 nmol/L (conventionally reported as missing 
values) back to the dataset. Adjusted regression models were used to investigate 
the determinants of profound (25OHD <10 nmol/L) and severe (10-25 nmol/L) 
vitamin D deficiency and to assess disease associations (with 25-50 nmol/L as 
the reference category).
RESULTS: 1,731 (0.48%) individuals were profoundly deficient and further 45,178 
(12.66%) individuals were severely vitamin D deficient. The proportions of 
profoundly and severely deficient were highest among Asians, 9% and 47%, 
respectively. Ambient UV radiation was the second strongest predictor: comparing 
the lowest vs. highest quartile, the risk of profound deficiency was 17-fold 
increased and of severe deficiency 7.49-fold increased. Use of vitamin D 
supplements substantially reduced risk of profound (4.4-fold) and severe 
(2.5-fold) deficiency, as did fish intake (5- and 1.87-fold, respectively). 
Profound deficiency was associated with a higher odds ratio compared to severe 
deficiency in chronic illness, diabetes, and emphysema.
CONCLUSION: The prevalence of profound and severe vitamin D deficiency among 
non-White ethnicities in the UK is extraordinarily high and requires targeted 
action. Solar radiation is potent in protecting against profound and severe 
vitamin D deficiency. Studies evaluating the relationship between vitamin D 
status and other health outcomes may be biased by excluding profoundly deficient 
participants.

INTRODUCTION: A rise in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) volume has led to an 
increased incidence of aseptic revision TKA (rTKA), resulting in significant 
associated healthcare costs. This study evaluated the economic impact and 
clinical factors associated with readmission following aseptic rTKA, aiming to 
identify key drivers of cost and risk factors for readmission.
METHODS: This retrospective analysis used data from a large national database 
from January 1, 2009, to June 30, 2022. Patients undergoing aseptic rTKA were 
identified via CPT (Current Procedural Terminology) codes. Readmissions within 
90 days postoperatively were analyzed. Baseline characteristics, comorbidities, 
and readmission costs were compared, and significant risk factors for 
readmission were identified. Of 34,144 aseptic rTKA patients, 1,953 (5.7%) were 
readmitted within 90 days (56.1% medical, 29.2% surgical, 14.8% unknown).
RESULTS: The median cost of all readmissions was $25,181. Readmissions requiring 
reoperation had a higher cost (median $40,524 versus $20,907, P < 0.001). Among 
readmissions for surgical complications, periprosthetic joint infection was the 
most common cause (36.3%) and was associated with the greatest cost (median 
$38,104). The most common medical causes of readmission were rehabilitative 
care, ischemic cardiac events, and acute kidney injury. Significant risk factors 
for all-cause readmission included men, index revision for periprosthetic 
fracture, and comorbidities, including diabetes, coronary artery disease, renal 
disease, and congestive heart failure.
CONCLUSION: Readmission after aseptic rTKA results in a major economic burden to 
the healthcare system, particularly in readmission pertaining to surgical 
complications and requiring reoperation. This study highlights the need for 
targeted strategies aimed at effectively reducing the rate of and costs 
associated with readmission post-rTKA with a goal of cost containment and 
improved patient outcomes.

AIM: The aims of this study were to compare the metabolic profiles of type 2 
diabetes mellitus patients with metformin and insulin monotherapy, to assess the 
associations of metabolites with major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) 
distinctly for metformin-only and insulin-only users, and to test for effect 
modification by the glucose-lowering treatment.
METHODS: We included 3,058 metformin-only and 558 insulin-only users from the UK 
Biobank. Mean concentrations of 249 metabolites of metformin and insulin users 
were compared with Cohen's d, their associations with MACE were assessed with 
Cox regression and interaction terms were tested.
RESULTS: Mean VLDL size, HDL size, and concentrations of large and very large 
HDL molecules differed between insulin-only and metformin-only users. Overall, 
75 metabolomic biomarkers were significantly associated with MACE in 
insulin-only users and 57 in metformin-only users. Significant interaction terms 
were observed between treatment group and albumin (protective in metformin users 
only) and 86 lipids/fatty acids, which were all statistically significantly 
associated with MACE among insulin users only.
CONCLUSION: Metformin and insulin users have different metabolic profiles and a 
consistent pattern emerged that the metabolic profile of metformin users is 
favorable compared to the one of insulin users due to a lower associated MACE 
risk.

AIMS: This study sought to analyze the association of social isolation and 
loneliness with the risk of type 2 diabetes onset.
METHODS: Two authors systematically searched PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science 
databases for studies published until February 2025, assessing the risk of 
incidence of type 2 diabetes in individuals who are socially isolated or lonely. 
To quantify the risk of incident diabetes, hazard ratios (HRs) for loneliness 
and social isolation were pooled using a random-effects inverse-variance model 
with empirical Bayes estimation.
RESULTS: Nine prospective cohort studies were included, comprising 1,112,887 
individuals (60.5 % female, mean age = 57.1 years), with 50,961 new cases of 
type 2 diabetes over a mean follow-up of 10.7 years. Loneliness was associated 
with a 32 % increased risk of type 2 diabetes (HR = 1.32 [95 % confidence 
interval [CI]:1.11-1.57]). Social isolation was linked to a 20 % higher risk 
(HR = 1.20 [95 %CI:1.01-1.43]). The included studies showed fair-to-good 
methodological quality (mean score: 10.11/14) based on the Quality Assessment 
Tool for Observational Cohort and Cross-Sectional Studies.
CONCLUSIONS: Social isolation and loneliness are significant risk factors for 
type 2 diabetes. Addressing social connectedness could be a valuable strategy 
for diabetes prevention, emphasizing the need to incorporate psychosocial 
factors into public health initiatives.

BACKGROUND: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a common microvascular complication of 
diabetes mellitus (DM). A number of studies have investigated if patients with 
diabetic retinopathy present altered arterial stiffness compared to diabetic 
individuals without retinopathy.
OBJECTIVES: To compare arterial stiffness parameters in participants with 
diabetic retinopathy (DR) compared to participants with diabetes without 
retinopathy METHODS: Medline and Scopus were searched for published articles 
comparing indices of arterial stiffness in participants with DR and in diabetic 
participants without retinopathy. Standardized Mean Difference (SMD) with 95% 
confidence interval (CI) was calculated for the comparisons. The study protocol 
was registered with PROSPERO with registration ID: CRD42023482577.
RESULTS: The meta-analysis analyzed 3 arterial stiffness parameters brachial 
ankle PWV, carotid-femoral PWV and augmentation index (AI). 8 studies were 
included in the analysis of brachial ankle PWV, 4 in the analysis of 
carotid-femoral PWV and 4 in the analysis of the augmentation index. Brachial 
ankle PWV, carotid-femoral PWV and augmentation index were found to be increased 
in participants with DR compared to diabetic participants without DR 
(SMD = 0.59, 95 %CI = 0.40-0.79, P < 0.00001, I2 = 89 %, SMD = 0.86, 
95 %CI = 0.55-1.18P < 0.00001, I2 = 91 % and SMD = 0.23, 95 %CI = 0.13-0.32, 
P < 0.00001, I2 = 0 %, respectively).
CONCLUSION: Diabetic participants with DR exhibit increased arterial stiffness 
compared to diabetic participants without DR.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is pathologically associated with gut microbiota 
imbalance, which is implicated in disease progression through metabolic and 
inflammatory pathways. The therapeutic potential of inulin, a well-characterized 
prebiotic, has been explored to mitigate T2DM via microbiota modulation. 
However, the efficacy of this intervention, with its performance dependent on 
the degree of polymerization (DP), requires further investigation. This study 
assessed the therapeutic roles of inulin (DP3-60) and fructo-oligosaccharides 
(FOS, DP3-10) in T2DM management. Dietary administration of these prebiotic 
compounds demonstrated a significant capacity to alleviate multiple metabolic 
pathologies, including obesity, insulin resistance, systemic inflammation, 
oxidative stress, dyslipidemia and hepatic steatosis in high-fat diet (HFD)-fed 
induced T2DM mice. Significant superior efficacy was observed in FOS for 
ameliorating glucose metabolic dysregulation, adipocyte hypertrophy, liver 
weight, and histopathological alterations in colonic tissue, while inulin 
exhibited greater potency in alleviating oxidative stress. Both inulin and FOS 
enhanced gut microbiota diversity and richness in T2DM mice, accompanied by a 
significant reduction in Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio. Notably, the S24-7 
family emerged as a crucial microbial taxon modulated by both inulin and FOS. 
Furthermore, FOS demonstrated superior capacity to restore HFD-induced gut 
microbiota. Taxonomically significant amplicon sequence variants (ASVs), which 
were altered by HFD and modulated by inulin and FOS, exhibited distinct 
taxonomic profiles between the two compounds. This study provides preliminary 
evidence that the biological effects and beneficial properties of inulin-type 
fructans exhibit DP-dependent variations, which may enhance their efficient 
utilization in metabolic disorders.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) 
study was conducted to assess the causal relationship between hypertension and 
BPV. Summary statistics for BPV and hypertension were obtained from the FinnGen 
biobank to support the primary MR analysis. Five complementary methods - inverse 
variance weighted, weighted median, MR-Egger, simple mode, and weighted mode - 
were applied to obtain MR estimates. Furthermore, a multivariable MR (MVMR) 
analysis was conducted to examine whether hypertension independently influences 
BPV.
RESULTS: The MR analysis indicated a significant causal effect of hypertension 
on BPV, with an odds ratio (OR) of 1.11 (95% CI: 1.02-1.22, p = .019), 
indicating an increased risk of BPV associated with hypertension. MVMR analysis 
further indicated that the causal effect of hypertension on BPV remained 
significant even after adjusting for menopausal disorders and ischemic stroke 
(OR: 1.108, 95% CI: 1.003-1.225, p = .043).
CONCLUSIONS AND SIGNIFICANCE: This MR study provided evidence supporting a 
causal effect of hypertension on BPV.

BACKGROUND: Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) patients are one of the 
important high-risk groups for the development of pre-eclampsia (PE). The 
pathogenesis of PE in GDM patients is not fully understood. This study aims to 
identify hub genes and pathways associated with the co-occurrence of GDM and PE.
METHODS: The matrix files of GDM and PE datasets were downloaded from GEO to 
identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs). The common DEGs were predicted 
for functional analysis through GO and KEGG analysis. A protein-protein 
interaction (PPI) network was constructed to determine the common hub genes for 
GDM and PE. Diagnostic hub genes were obtained through regression modeling and 
ROC analysis, and validated in publicly available datasets. The differences in 
immune infiltration between GDM and PE were analyzed. The expression and role of 
common hub genes in the co-occurrence of GDM and PE were explored through 
analysis of single-cell sequencing data.
RESULTS: A total of 104 DEGs were identified between GDM and PE. These common 
DEGs were found to be involved in mucosal immune response and the JAK-STAT 
signaling pathway. A total of 27 common hub genes were identified for both GDM 
and PE. BCL6, DNAH9, and SCG2 were identified as potential diagnostic biomarkers 
for PE. BCL6 showed high expression in neutrophils and villous cytotrophoblasts 
(VCTs) in both PE and GDM.
CONCLUSION: This study identified BCL6, DNAH9, and SCG2 as common hub genes in 
GDM and PE. BCL6 is expected to be a new target for the diagnosis and treatment 
of GDM concurrent with PE.

AIMS: Current off-label bisphosphonate treatment for osteogenesis imperfecta 
(OI) does not induce healthy bone formation. Therefore, novel strategies to 
stimulate osteogenesis and reduce fractures are needed to meet the medical needs 
of these patients. Preclinical data and case studies show that multiple 
intravenous (IV) administrations of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) provide 
promising outcomes in the treatment of OI. In the Boost to Brittle Bones 
(BOOST2B) trial, we aim to assess the safety and tolerability of multiple IV and 
intraosseous (IO) administrations of foetal liver-derived MSCs in children aged 
one to five years diagnosed with severe OI.
METHODS: A total of 15 children will receive four doses of foetal MSCs IV (3 × 
106 cells per kg of body weight) and IO (0.1 × 106 cells per kg of body weight 
per long bone) at four-month intervals. As a secondary endpoint, the therapeutic 
effect of the four MSC doses will be assessed based on the annual fracture rate, 
time to first fracture, bone mineral density, growth, clinical status of OI, and 
biochemical bone turnover in peripheral blood. Exploratory parameters include 
quality of life and donor cell engraftment.
CONCLUSION: The BOOST2B trial has been approved by the regulatory agencies in 
India and is ongoing. It is the first clinical trial designed to evaluate IO 
administration of MSCs as a potential therapy for OI. Here, we describe the 
BOOST2B clinical trial protocol. The long-term data on safety and efficacy will 
be reported once completed.

By combining network pharmacological analysis and animal model experiments, the 
research aims to understand the pharmacological profile and mechanisms of 
Anemarrhenae rhizoma (Zhimu) and Trichosanthis radix (Tianhuafen) herb-pair (AT) 
in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) treatment. The results of GO and KEGG 
enrichment analyses suggested that AT exerted pharmacological effects on T2DM by 
regulating PI3K/Akt signalling pathway. Finally, molecular docking confirmed a 
strong binding affinity between AT with the core target proteins. Further in 
vitro experiments have confirmed that AT treatment significantly reduced body 
weight, blood glucose, and insulin levels, also blocking the activation of the 
PI3K/Akt signalling pathway.

BACKGROUND: Given Japan's rapidly ageing demographic structure, comprehensive 
and long-term evaluations of its national and subnational health progress are 
important to inform public health policy. This study aims to assess Japan's 
population health, using the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk 
Factors Study (GBD) 2021 to analyse the country's evolving disease patterns.
METHODS: GBD 2021 used Japanese data from 1474 sources, covering 371 diseases, 
including COVID-19, and 88 risk factors. The analysis included estimates of life 
expectancy, mortality, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs). Estimates 
were generated using the standardised GBD methodology, which incorporates 
various data sources through statistical modelling, including the Cause Of Death 
Ensemble Model for mortality, Bayesian Meta-Regression Disease Model for 
non-fatal outcomes, and risk factor estimation frameworks to quantify 
attributable burdens. Life expectancy decomposition by cause of death and 
annualised rates of change of age-standardised mortality and DALYs were 
calculated for 1990-2005, 2005-15, and 2015-21.
FINDINGS: Between 1990 and 2021, life expectancy in Japan rose from 79·4 years 
(95% uncertainty interval 79·3-79·4) to 85·2 years (85·1-85·2), with 
prefecture-level disparities widening. Gains were primarily driven by reduced 
mortality from stroke (adding 1·5 years to life expectancy), ischaemic heart 
disease (1·0 years), and neoplasms, particularly stomach cancer (0·5 years), 
with variation across prefectures. Leading causes of death in 2021 were 
Alzheimer's disease and other dementias (135·3 deaths [39·5-312·3] per 100 000 
population), stroke (114·9 [89·8-129·3] per 100 000), ischaemic heart disease 
(96·5 [77·7-106·7] per 100 000), and lung cancer (72·1 [61·8-77·5] per 100 000). 
Age-standardised mortality for major non-communicable diseases declined, but the 
pace of this decline has slowed. All-cause annualised rate of change in 
mortality rate decreased from -1·6% for 2005-15 to -1·1% for 2015-21. 
Age-standardised COVID-19 mortality rates were 0·8 deaths (0·7-0·9) per 100 000 
population (accounting for 0·3% of all deaths) in 2020 and 3·0 (2·5-3·7) per 
100 000 population in 2021 (1·0% of deaths). Age-standardised DALY rates for 
diabetes worsened, with annualised rate of change increasing from 0·1% for 
2005-15 to 2·2% for 2015-21. This change parallels worsening trends in major 
risk factors, particularly high fasting plasma glucose (annualised rate of 
change of attributable DALYs -0·8% for 2005-15 and 0·8% for 2015-21) and high 
BMI (0·2% and 1·4%, respectively). Age-standardised DALYs attributable to other 
major risk factors continued to decrease, albeit slower.
INTERPRETATION: Japan's health gains over the past 30 years are now stalling, 
with rising regional disparities. The increasing burdens of Alzheimer's disease 
and other dementias and diabetes, alongside high fasting plasma glucose and high 
BMI, highlight areas needing focused attention and action.

Hydrogels are three-dimensional structures that replicate natural tissues' 
extracellular matrix (ECM). They are essential for transporting exudates, gases, 
and moisture and facilitating cellular interactions in tissue engineering and 
wound healing. The choice of primary material in designing the scaffold is 
necessary to be paid more attention rather than common sources, including plant 
fibres like cotton, bamboo, and algae, as well as bacterial and marine-derived 
materials. Among them, cellulose-based polymers are especially valued for their 
biocompatibility and ability to promote wound healing. Chronic diabetic wounds 
pose unique treatment challenges, such as necrosis and infection risks. 
Consequently, a growing interest is in incorporating bioactive molecules into 
cellulose-based hydrogels. This article investigates how these infused hydrogels 
enhance the healing process in chronic diabetic wounds, examining various 
loading and crosslinking techniques alongside their clinical applications. It 
also discusses the benefits and limitations of bioactive molecules and their 
interactions with hydrogels to improve treatment strategies.

Plain Language Summary: Cellulose-based hydrogels derived from natural sources, 
including plant fibres and marine organisms, are explored.These hydrogels 
significantly improve the healing of chronic diabetic wounds, especially when 
bioactive molecules are incorporated, effectively addressing necrosis and 
infection.This review evaluates various techniques for loading and cross-linking 
these hydrogels, discussing their current and future clinical applications, and 
highlighting their potential for enhanced treatment options.

Prehabilitation- Do we need metabolic flexibility.

Tetlow N, Whittle J.

Metabolic flexibility, the capacity to switch between energy sources in response 
to changing physiological demands, emerges as a critical determinant of 
perioperative resilience. In the context of surgery, where metabolic demands are 
high and energy homeostasis is disrupted, patients with metabolic inflexibility 
may experience worse outcomes due to impaired immune responses and heightened 
insulin resistance, resulting in prolonged recovery times. This article explores 
the implications of metabolic flexibility in the perioperative period and 
examines the potential for prehabilitation strategies, such as targeted exercise 
and nutritional interventions, to improve patient readiness for surgery. 
Cardio-pulmonary exercise testing (CPET) is discussed as a valuable assessment 
tool for metabolic flexibility, capable of providing insights into a patient's 
fuel adaptability and overall metabolic health preoperatively. Evidence suggests 
that targeted exercise and nutritional strategies can enhance mitochondrial 
function, improve nutrient-sensing pathways, and increase substrate oxidation, 
which may reduce perioperative complications and support immune resilience. 
Future research should focus on refining methods to identify metabolically 
inflexible patients and tailoring prehabilitation interventions to optimise 
metabolic flexibility, particularly in populations vulnerable to metabolic 
dysfunction, such as those with obesity, diabetes, and cancer. This approach may 
establish new standards in perioperative care by aligning metabolic readiness 
with surgical recovery demands.

Dapagliflozin Treatment Attenuates the Interaction Between the Renal Sodium 
Chloride co-transporter and Ezrin in Hypertensive Diabetic db/db Mice.

Gholam MF, Alli AA.

INTRODUCTION: Ezrin is a protein that links the actin cytoskeleton to membrane 
proteins. The sodium chloride cotransporter (NCC) plays a key role in regulating 
total body electrolyte homeostasis and systemic blood pressure. Dapagliflozin, 
an SGLT2 inhibitor, is used to manage type 2 diabetes mellitus. We hypothesize 
dapagliflozin reduces sodium reabsorption and blood pressure by inhibiting the 
interaction between NCC and ezrin in the distal convoluted tubules of 
salt-loaded hypertensive mice.
METHODS: Male diabetic db/db mice were salt loaded to induce hypertension and 
then given dapagliflozin or vehicle by oral gavage. The mice were subject to 
metabolic cage experiments and blood pressure was assessed using the tail-cuff 
method to study the impact of dapagliflozin compared to the vehicle. Protein 
expression of NCC and ezrin were evaluated using immunohistochemistry and 
Western blotting.
RESULTS: Treatment with dapagliflozin lowered systolic blood pressure, raised 
urine sodium excretion, and lowered urinary potassium excretion. A decrease in 
phospho-NCC and ezrin proteins was observed in db/db mice treated with 
dapagliflozin. There was less co-localization of ezrin and phosphorylated NCC in 
dapagliflozin treated mice.
CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, we demonstrate that dapagliflozin reduces sodium 
retention and blood pressure via decreasing the density of renal NCC at the 
luminal membrane and the interaction between NCC and the actin cytoskeleton.

Second Opinion SGLT2 Inhibitors and Uric acid.

Sanchez-Lozada LG, Lanaspa MA, Rodriguez-Iturbe B, Brown JM, Madero M, Johnson 
RJ.

The use of SGLT2 inhibitors have had remarkable success in the management of 
chronic kidney disease, by both slowing progression and reducing cardiovascular 
mortality. Among their many actions, SGLT2 inhibitors have also been found to 
lower serum uric acid, likely by both enhancing urinary excretion and blocking 
urate production. A recent study by Mayne et al reported that SGLT2 inhibitors 
lowered uric acid levels in the EMPA-Kidney trial, but did not provide any 
significant protection from gout nor have effect on kidney outcomes. However, 
there is increasing evidence that lowering of uric acid by SGLT2 inhibitors in 
subjects with diabetes or heart failure can reduce acute episodes of gout as 
well as urate kidney stones. Given the frequency of hyperuricemia and gout in 
the subject with CKD, we believe that more studies are needed, and that likely 
there is some benefit in hyperuricemic subjects with CKD.

BACKGROUND: The Mediterranean lifestyle is widely recognized for its role in 
reducing the risk of chronic diseases, including cardiovascular diseases, type 2 
diabetes, and cancer. The PREVESMED questionnaire was developed to evaluate 
adherence to this lifestyle, integrating dietary and non-dietary behaviors. 
Unlike existing tools, PREVESMED incorporates underexplored elements such as 
eating pace, herbal tea consumption, and physical activity, providing a 
multidimensional approach to lifestyle assessment.
METHODS: The validation of PREVESMED was carried out as part of a planned 
interim analysis using data collected from participants in the PREVES-ENERGY 
survey, a cross-sectional study targeting 1,000 adults aged 18 years and above. 
To assess the reliability of the PREVESMED scale, internal consistency was 
evaluated using Cronbach's alpha, ensuring an acceptable level of reliability. 
To investigate the relationships between lifestyle factors, individual 
questionnaire items, and adherence to Mediterranean lifestyle according to the 
PREVESMED scale, a correlation analysis was performed. Additionally, to identify 
significant predictors of better adherence, a multivariable linear regression 
model was utilized, highlighting key factors influencing adherence. Finally, an 
exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was conducted to reveal the underlying 
structure of the PREVESMED scale, identifying key dimensions and their 
contributions to the total variance.
RESULTS: The cohort analyzed for the preliminary validation of the PREVESMED 
questionnaire consisted of 268 participants, in line with the protocol's planned 
sample size. Internal consistency analysis demonstrated acceptable reliability 
(Cronbach's alpha = 0.628). In the correlation analysis, the strongest 
associations with the total PREVESMED score emerged for physical activity, extra 
virgin olive oil use, and fruit/vegetable consumption, whereas daily alcohol 
intake showed the weakest correlation. The multivariable linear regression 
highlighted higher education, lower BMI, nonsmoking status, higher WHO-5 scores, 
and older age as significant predictors of better adherence. Exploratory factor 
analysis identified five factors explaining 59.32% of the total variance.
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that the PREVESMED questionnaire is a 
promising, multidimensional tool for evaluating adherence to a Mediterranean 
lifestyle, demonstrating acceptable reliability and significant associations 
with key health indicators. Further refinement and extended validation - 
encompassing test-retest reliability, weighted scoring, and biomarker 
correlations - will strengthen its applicability across diverse populations.

PREVESMED auch bisher wenig erforschte Elemente wie die Essgeschwindigkeit, den 
Kräuterteekonsum oder die körperliche Aktivität und stellt damit einen 
multidimensionalen Ansatz zur Beurteilung der Lebensführung 
dar.<title>Methoden</title> Die Validierung des PREVESMED erfolgte im Rahmen 
einer planmäßigen Zwischenanalyse von Teilnehmerdaten aus der 
PREVES-ENERGY-Erhebung, einer Querschnittsstudie mit einer Zielgruppe von 1'000 
Erwachsenen ab 18 Jahren. Zur Beurteilung der Reliabilität der PREVESMED-Skala 
wurde die interne Konsistenz anhand des Cronbachs-Alpha-Werts evaluiert und so 
ein akzeptables Maß an Reliabilität sichergestellt. Zur Beurteilung der 
Zusammenhänge zwischen den Aspekten der Lebensführung, einzelnen 
Fragebogen-Items und der Adhärenz laut PREVESMED-Skala wurde eine 
Korrelationsanalyse durchgeführt. Zusätzlich wurde zur Identifizierung 
signifikanter Prädiktoren für höhere Adhärenz ein multivariables lineares 
Regressionsmodell angewandt, das wichtige Einflussfaktoren auf die Adhärenz 
aufzeigte. Schließlich wurde noch eine Explorative Faktorenanalyse (EFA) 
durchgeführt, um die zugrunde liegende Struktur der PREVESMED-Skala offenzulegen 
und wichtige Dimensionen und deren Beitrag zur Gesamtvarianz zu 
identifizieren.<title>Ergebnisse</title> Die für die vorläufige Validierung des

Prüfplan vorgesehenen Stichprobengröße entsprechend. Die interne 
Konsistenzanalyse ergab eine akzeptable Reliabilität (Cronbachs Alpha = 0.628). 
In der Korrelationsanalyse zeigten sich die stärksten Assoziationen mit dem 
PREVESMED-Gesamtscore bei den Aspekten körperliche Aktivität, zusätzlicher 
Olivenölkonsum und Obst-/Gemüsekonsum, während der tägliche Alkoholkonsum die 
schwächste Korrelation aufwies. Als signifikante Prädiktoren für höhere Adhärenz 
erwiesen sich in der multivariablen linearen Regressionsanalyse ein höherer 
Bildungsstand, niedrigerer BMI, Nichtraucherstatus, höhere WHO-5-Scores und 
höheres Lebensalter. In der explorativen Faktorenanalyse wurden fünf Faktoren 
identifiziert, die 59.32% der Gesamtvarianz 
erklärten.<title>Schlussfolgerung</title> Unsere Ergebnisse deuten darauf hin, 
dass der PREVESMED-Fragebogen ein vielversprechendes multidimensionales 
Instrument für die Beurteilung der Adhärenz zu einer mediterranen Lebensführung 
darstellt, da er akzeptable Reliabilität und signifikante Assoziationen mit 
wichtigen Gesundheitsindikatoren gezeigt hat. Eine weitere Verfeinerung und 
erweiterte Validierung, welche auch die Wiederholungs-Reliabilität, gewichtetes 
Scoring und Biomarker-Korrelationen umfasst, wird die Anwendbarkeit dieses 
Instruments bei unterschiedlichen Bevölkerungsgruppen weiter stärken.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: As the global population ages, frailty and pain have 
become two significant health issues that impact the quality of life in older 
adults. Previous studies have not thoroughly explored the relationship between 
them. This study aims to investigate the longitudinal association between 
frailty and pain using data from prospective cohorts in China (CHARLS), the 
United Kingdom (ELSA), and the United States (HRS).
METHODS: This study utilized data from three prospective cohort studies: the 
China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS), the English 
Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA), and the Health and Retirement Study (HRS). 
Frailty status was assessed using the Rockwood frailty index and categorized 
into robust, pre-frail, and frail. Pain was evaluated by self-reports. Pain 
degrees were categorized into mild, moderate and severe. Pain areas were grouped 
into four main areas: head and neck, trunk, limbs, oral. Generalized linear 
mixed-effects models were employed to analyze the longitudinal relationship 
between frailty and pain while adjusting for covariates, including gender, age, 
marital status, education level, sleep quality, smoking, drinking, hypertension, 
and diabetes.
RESULTS: According to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 10,624 participants 
from CHARLS (47% female, mean age: 60.76 years), 4945 participants from ELSA 
(52.2% female, mean age: 70.05 years), and 11,439 participants from HRS (55.8% 
female, mean age: 69.28 years) were included in the subsequent analysis. 
Compared to robust individuals, those in pre-frail and frail states showed a 
significantly increased risk of experiencing pain. In all three cohorts, 
pre-frail individuals had a 3.82-fold increased likelihood of pain compared to 
robust individuals (OR = 3.82, 95%CI = 3.51-4.15, p-value < 0.001, CHARLS), 
4.29-fold (OR = 4.29, 95%CI = 3.74-4.93, p-value < 0.001, ELSA), and 4.17-fold 
(OR = 4.17, 95%CI = 3.81-4.57 p-value < 0.001, HRS). Frail individuals had a 
10.44-fold increased likelihood of pain (OR = 10.44, 95%CI = 9.05-12.04, 
p-value < 0.001, CHARLS), 10.14-fold (OR = 10.14, 95%CI = 8.05-12.76, 
p-value < 0.001, ELSA), and 13.27-fold (OR = 13.27, 95%CI = 11.71-15.03, 
p-value < 0.001, HRS).
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that frailty significantly impacts the risk 
of pain, the degree of pain, and the areas of pain. And this association is 
consistently observed across older populations in different countries. Future 
pain management strategies should incorporate frailty assessments to mitigate 
the adverse effects of pain on the health of older adults.

Bone regeneration and repair face formidable challenges under diabetic 
conditions, primarily due to the disruption of macrophage polarization induced 
by diabetes and the inflammatory imbalance within the bone microenvironment. We 
have developed a novel dynamic hydrogel system (AG-CD@LINA), constructed through 
the coordination crosslinking of thiolated gelatin (SH-Gelatin) and gold ions 
(Au3+), followed by grafting with cyclodextrin to load the ligand linagliptin. 
This hydrogel effectively inhibits the formation of M1 macrophages and the 
expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines by gradually releasing linagliptin. 
Simultaneously, it promotes the formation of M2 macrophages and the expression 
of anti-inflammatory cytokines, thus improving the inflammatory microenvironment 
of diabetic bone defects. Consequently, it facilitates the migration of 
mesenchymal stem cells and angiogenic cells, augments osteogenic activity, and 
promotes vascularization, collectively accelerating the regeneration of diabetic 
bone tissue. Mechanistically, polarization occurs through the TLR3-NF-κB 
signaling pathway. In vivo experiments demonstrate that the in-situ injection of 
the hydrogel enhances the regeneration of bone tissue and the restoration of 
bone structure in diabetic bone defects, effectively modulating local 
inflammation and promoting vascular formation. This study suggests that 
functionalized dynamic hydrogels can improve the inflammatory microenvironment 
by regulating in situ macrophage polarization, thereby facilitating the 
reconstruction of bone microstructure. This approach represents a promising 
novel therapeutic strategy for diabetic bone defects.

To prevent chronic disease from getting worse, it is important to detect and 
predict it at an early stage. Therefore, the accuracy of the prediction is 
particularly important. To investigate the accuracy of different methods, this 
study compares the out-of-sample errors of machine learning algorithms and 
traditional econometric methods in predicting diabetes. The object of prediction 
in this study is fasting blood glucose, and the machine learning algorithms used 
are stepwise selection, bagging, random forests and support vector machine 
(SVM). In addition, we demonstrate the linear combination of above machine 
learning algorithms in this study. The findings indicate that the combined model 
outperforms both traditional econometric models and individual machine learning 
algorithms. However, the predictive performance of individual machine learning 
models does not consistently surpass that of traditional econometric approaches. 
Based on the data characteristics analyzed in this study, a possible explanation 
for this finding is that traditional econometric methods may exhibit superior 
performance in linear data prediction. Finally, the analysis of variable 
importance suggests that medical indicators and physical condition may play a 
more significant role in determining fasting blood glucose compared to 
hereditary factors. To further validate our results, we applied the same 
methodology to predict hypertension using the same dataset. The findings 
similarly indicated that the predictive ability of individual machine learning 
algorithms does not always surpass that of traditional econometric models. And a 
linear combination of the four machine learning algorithms enhances the 
predictive accuracy for hypertension.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Individuals with schizophrenia are at high risk of 
developing type 2 diabetes. This study aimed to develop a tailored solution to 
address their complex diabetes care needs, based on insights from patients and 
healthcare professionals, to enhance self-care.
METHODS: Using a Participatory Design approach, we conducted three workshops and 
an evaluation, which included focus groups, interviews, and written feedback. 
Patients, healthcare professionals, and stakeholders actively participated in 
all stages of the process between May 2022 and December 2023. Iterative 
processes ensured comprehensive input in idea generation and concept 
development. Data analysis followed the steps of planning, acting, observing, 
and reflecting. The study is reported using SRQR framework.
RESULTS: Participants highlighted challenges such as navigating a fragmented 
healthcare system, undertreatment, and stigma. In response, a tailored 
educational manual for voluntary mentors was developed. This two-day training 
program equips mentors to support individuals with type 2 diabetes and 
schizophrenia, fostering collaboration and bridging the gap between psychiatric 
and somatic care.
CONCLUSIONS: A co-designed approach may enhance diabetes self-care and improve 
coordination between healthcare sectors.

Among the concerning commercial practices are those related to sugar-sweetened 
beverages (SSBs), which offer little nutritional value and contribute to 
energy-dense diets. Excessive SSB consumption is associated with obesity, a 
major risk factor for non-communicable diseases (NCDs), particularly Type 2 
Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM). The rise in SSB consumption in Indonesia, driven by 
commercial factors, increases the risk of T2DM and related health burdens. This 
study aims to investigate SSB consumption patterns, caloric intake, and 
socio-demographic characteristics affecting T2DM prevalence, using probit 
regression estimates based on National Socioeconomic Survey (SUSENAS) 2018 and 
Basic Health Research (Riskesdas) 2018. The sample size comprises 699,959 
individuals, with the unit of analysis focused on individual health outcomes. 
Our descriptive result implies that 76.49 % incurred expenses on at least one 
type of SSB in the past week. Ready-to-drink beverages were the most frequently 
consumed, while factory-produced liquid milk had the lowest average consumption. 
Probit regression analysis indicated that higher SSB caloric consumption 
significantly increased the probability of a T2DM diagnosis. This study 
underscores the need for targeted interventions to reduce SSB consumption and 
address T2DM risk factors, especially among higher-income households and 
specific regions.

AIM: To determine whether people with type 1 diabetes (T1D) initiating glucose 
sensor monitoring experience greater improvements in HbA1c when provided with 
education on carbohydrate counting and flexible insulin dosing than those who do 
not receive nutrition education.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our retrospective observational study included 329 people 
with T1D initiating glucose sensor monitoring between 2015 and 2021. The 
participants were divided into two groups: one group attended at least one 
structured educational session with a registered dietitian (n = 126), while the 
other group did not receive structured education (n = 203). After 12 months of 
glucose sensor initiation, we compared glycaemic outcomes and CGM metrics 
between the two groups.
RESULTS: At glucose sensor initiation, both groups with and without education 
had similar HbA1c levels (7.64% [60.0 mmol/mol] vs. 7.66% [60.2 mmol/mol]). 
After twelve months, the education group demonstrated greater improvement in 
glycemic outcomes (HbA1c 7.17% [54.9mmol/mol] vs. 7.37% [57.1 mmol/mol], 
p < 0.05) and spent significantly more time in the target range than did the 
group without structured education (68.8% vs. 64.1%, p < 0.05). We observed an 
inverse correlation between the number of completed educational sessions and 
HbA1c after 12 months, as well as between the number of educational sessions and 
the change in HbA1c.
CONCLUSIONS: People with T1D who initiated glucose sensor monitoring alongside 
nutrition education showed greater improvements in HbA1c and increased time 
spent in the target glucose range compared to individuals who did not receive 
structured education.

Antihypertensive medications known as angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) have 
become increasingly popular for treating conditions beyond hypertension. The 
reason for this widespread use is mainly due to their Reno protective and 
cardioprotective properties in patients with congestive heart failure and 
diabetes mellitus. There have been conflicting studies on the relationship 
between ARBs and haematological abnormalities. Using the supplied search terms, 
we carried out a thorough search for relevant papers written in English and 
published before July 2023. All of the studies that met the selection criteria 
were searched for on PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar. Based on the 
examined data from the searched literatures, it has been demonstrated that 
angiotensin II is essential for stimulation of erythropoiesis and inhibition of 
it by drugs such as ARBs can lower haematocrit levels, leading to anaemia. 
Accordingly, dose reduction or stopping administration of ARBs could be a choice 
for correction of anaemia. However, such decision is based on the clinical 
situation and the requirements for other management options.

BACKGROUND: Diabetes mellitus is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, 
with many ocular severe complications. This cross-sectional study determined 
adherence to proper eye care recommendations and regular eye examinations among 
local diabetic patients and factors associated with non-adherence.
METHODS: This cross-sectional survey assed the knowledge, attitude, and 
practices of 200 type I and II diabetic patients. The frequency of patients' 
regular eye examinations, good knowledge of diabetic eye disease, and measures 
of the association of periodic eye examination with different variables were 
calculated.
RESULTS: There were 116 (58%) males and 84 (42%) females (mean age=55.28 years, 
SD=13.928 years). The majority belonged to the lower socioeconomic group with 
little education. 114 (57%) had never had any eye examination. 107 were unaware 
of the importance of eye examination. Only 35 (17.5%) had good knowledge, and 
146 (73%) patients had poor attitudes towards diabetes. Periodic eye examination 
was significantly associated with occupation, area of residence, and overall 
knowledge of diabetic eye complications. In contrast, it had no significant 
association with gender, type of diabetes, presence of eye symptoms, or presence 
of other diabetes complications.
CONCLUSIONS: The knowledge of our local population about diabetic eye disease is 
very deficient. An extensive campaign of educating diabetic patients about 
ocular complications is necessary to address this.

BACKGROUND: Diabetes mellitus is a disease with many possible complications like 
macrovascular, i.e., stroke, coronary artery disease, peripheral artery disease, 
and microvascular, i.e., retinopathy, neuropathy and nephropathy. Many studies 
have been done in past to find the frequencies of these complications and their 
association with sociodemographic determinants of diabetic patients, but there 
was limited data available in our setup. This study was carried out to determine 
the frequency of micro and macrovascular complications of diabetic patients and 
their association with socioeconomic determinants at Ayub Teaching Hospital, 
Abbottabad.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study was carried out at Ayub Teaching Hospital, 
Abbottabad, Pakistan, from July 2022 till December 2023 on 113 diabetic 
patients. The data was collected on micro and macrovascular complications of 
diabetes on a pre-designed structured proforma and analyzed by means of SPSS-23.
RESULTS: The most common macrovascular complication was coronary artery disease 
10 (8.8%) while neuropathy 35 (31%) was the most common microvascular 
complication. Among macrovascular complications stroke was associated 
significantly with age (p=0.01) and duration of diabetes (p=0.032). Among 
microvascular complications neuropathy was associated with gender (p=0.047), 
nephropathy with smoking (p=0.02) and retinopathy with both gender (p=0.019) and 
smoking (p=0.017).
CONCLUSIONS: In this study there was significant association between, gender 
with neuropathy and retinopathy, smoking with nephropathy and retinopathy, 
stroke with age and duration of diabetes.

BACKGROUND: Admission for heart failure poses a significant risk of readmission. 
Evaluating readmission rates in settings lacking chronic disease management 
programs could provide valuable insights to advocate for the establishment of 
such services.
METHODS: This study focused on patients admitted to the Cardiology Department of 
Ayub Medical Teaching Institute with acute decompensated heart failure. After 
excluding patients based on exclusion criteria, demographic and clinical data 
were recorded, including symptoms, signs, discharge medications, and readmission 
status within 6 months. Patients not readmitted were contacted via telephone at 
1, 3, and 6 months. Readmission rates and time to first readmission or death 
were documented.
RESULTS: A total of 222 patients were enrolled, with 60% being males. All 
patients exhibited pulmonary congestion, with 85% classified as NYHA Class III 
or IV. Comorbidities included hypertension (59%), history of myocardial 
infarction (45.49%), and diabetes (38.28%). Within 6 months, 21% of patients 
were readmitted, and 13% died before readmission, resulting in an overall death 
or readmission rate of 34% at 6 months. No significant differences were observed 
between readmitted and non-readmitted patients regarding sex, age, creatinine 
levels, haemoglobin levels, sodium levels, or ejection fraction. Utilization of 
guideline-directed medical treatment was low.
CONCLUSION: The high rate of readmission or death among patients admitted with 
acute decompensated heart failure underscores the necessity for implementing 
multidisciplinary care to closely monitor these patients.

Industrialization and modernization have changed the environment. A group of 
emerging contaminants (ECs) has been defined recently. Psoriasis, whose 
incidence has increased in recent years, is a relapsing immune-mediated disease 
carrying a heavy disease burden. The erythematous scaly plaque is a typical 
symptom and occurs on several parts of the body. In addition, psoriasis has many 
comorbidities, such as psoriatic arthritis, diabetes, and depression, damaging 
the quality of life of patients. IL-17, IL-12, IL-23, and TNF-alpha are 
important related cytokines. ECs can influence psoriasis through the immune 
system and inflammatory responses. Specific mechanisms include increasing 
pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-17, and activating immune cells 
such as macrophages. And for psoriasis patients, it is suggested to reduce the 
exposure of most ECs. However, the complex mechanisms involved have not been 
discussed together and concluded. In this review, we summarize the relationship 
between ECs and psoriasis, focusing on the immune system, especially the immune 
cells and cytokines. These results can help guide clinical treatment and 
long-term management of psoriasis.

BACKGROUND: While there have been studies comparing the efficiency of several 
metabolic operations in overweight or obese individuals with type 2 diabetes 
mellitus (T2DM), there is currently no comprehensive evidence about the complete 
remission of diabetes and its long-term safety.
METHODS: This comprehensive review and network meta-analysis encompassed 
searches of many databases including PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, the 
Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Scopus, 
ClinicalTrials.gov, and Google Scholar. The search was conducted from the 
beginning of these databases' existence until 1 May 2024. The study selected 
randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with a 5-year follow-up period to compare 
the clinical benefits and evaluate the occurrence of side events. The network 
meta-analysis employed a random-effects model. The registration number for 
PROSPERO is CRD42023412536.
RESULTS: There was a total of 16 RCTs that included 1059 patients. A total of 
897 patients, representing 84.7% of the entire sample, successfully completed 
the 5-year follow-up. Seven metabolic procedures were conducted. All ensuing 
estimates are to the comparison with a non-surgical treatment (NST). The 
evidence strongly supports that One-anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB) is the 
most effective surgical procedure for achieving long-term complete remission of 
diabetes (relative risk [RR] 10.28, 95% CI 1.87 to 56.40). Additionally, 
Biliopancreatic diversion (BPD) is the most effective procedure for achieving 
long-term partial remission of diabetes (RR 16.74, 95% CI 4.66 to 60.12). The 
study found that BPD was the most successful method for long-term weight loss, 
with a mean difference of -11.68 in BMI decrease (95% CI -15.06 to -8.31) and a 
mean difference of -32.01 in weight change (95% CI -43.27 to -20.74). The 
evidence supporting this conclusion is of moderate quality. Regarding the 
occurrence of adverse events and complications related to surgery, 
gastrointestinal, macrovascular, and microvascular issues are not as frequent in 
BPD compared with NST (relative risk 0.29, 95% confidence interval 0.06 to 
1.37). On the other hand, OAGB may have a higher occurrence of these 
difficulties, second only to BPD (relative risk 0.08, 95% confidence interval 
0.2 to 3.29). Based on the findings on effectiveness and safety, it has been 
determined that OAGB (One Anastomosis Gastric Bypass) is more effective in 
obtaining long-term complete remission of diabetes and in assuring overall 
safety in diabetes management. However, BPD is superior to OAGB in terms of 
partial remission, weight loss and safety in diabetes management, ranking second 
in these aspects.
CONCLUSIONS: Both BPD and OAGB have been demonstrated superior efficacy in 
achieving long-term weight loss and diabetes remission in overweight/obese 
individuals with T2DM. OAGB is particularly advantageous for achieving long-term 
complete remission of diabetes mellitus and boasts a higher level of safety 
overall. The study found that BPD was the most efficacious treatment for 
achieving partial remission and weight loss in patients with long-term diabetes, 
while also having the lowest number of reported side events.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) has diverse etiologies and complex pathogenesis, 
and is prone to recurrent episodes and prolonged illness. In recent years, the 
prevalence of CKD has been increasing year by year, and the global prevalence in 
the general population has reached 14.3%. Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is a 
common complication of diabetes mellitus (DM), and about 20-40% of DM patients 
have combined DKD, which is also the main cause of CKD and end-stage renal 
disease (ESRD). DM catalyzes CKD in approximately 30-50% of global cases, 
affecting around 285 million individuals. It primarily triggers diabetic 
nephropathy (DN), the leading cause of end-stage renal disease worldwide. 
Research indicates that activation of the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) plays 
a role in the onset and progression of DKD. Counteracting MR overactivation 
offers antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, and anti-fibrotic benefits, thereby 
ameliorating target organ damage. MR antagonists (MRAs) such as spironolactone 
and eplerenone have been validated for renal protection. However, their clinical 
application is hindered by adverse effects including hyperkalemia, gynecomastia 
in males, erectile dysfunction, and menstrual irregularities in females. 
Finerenone, a novel non-steroidal MRA, exhibits a unique mechanism of action, 
binding to MR and inhibiting the recruitment of transcription co-factors 
involved in gene expression, effectively slowing the progression of diabetic 
nephropathy (DN). In addition, finerenone demonstrates improved safety and 
efficacy in treating heart failure and chronic kidney disease. It also plays a 
significant role in the management of atrial fibrillation and myocardial 
infarction. This article reviews recent studies on finerenone, summarizing its 
mechanism of action in treating DN, evidence from clinical trials, adverse 
reactions, combined use with other inhibitors, and future prospective, aiming to 
provide insights for the prevention and treatment of DN.

Kyrle disease (KD) is a rare dermatologic condition characterized by 
hyperkeratotic papules with central keratotic plugs, often associated with 
systemic conditions such as diabetes and chronic kidney disease. Due to its 
clinical overlap with other dermatologic disorders, KD is frequently 
misdiagnosed. Diagnosis primarily relies on characteristic histopathological 
findings, with dermoscopy serving as a valuable adjunct for clinical assessment. 
This systematic review highlights KD's clinical features, systemic associations, 
dermoscopy findings, differential diagnosis, and current treatment approaches. 
While some therapies have shown promise, the lack of standardized management 
underscores the need for further research. By consolidating the existing 
literature, this systematic review emphasizes the importance of a 
multidisciplinary approach in managing KD and calls for future studies to 
establish standardized diagnostic and therapeutic protocols to improve patient 
outcomes.

Glucose and lipid metabolic aberrations in preterm and low birth weight infants: 
Associations with lifestyle-related diseases.

Nagano N(1), Morioka I(1).

Author information:

Medicine, Itabashi-ku, Tokyo, Japan.

The concept of the developmental origins of health and disease is well 
established. Prenatal undernutrition, resulting from a mismatch between pre- and 
postnatal environments, leads to permanent changes in body composition, 
function, and metabolism. These changes contribute to the development of 
lifestyle-related diseases such as type 2 diabetes mellitus and hyperlipidemia 
later in life. The future risk of lifestyle-related diseases in preterm and 
low-birth-weight infants is closely related to a thrifty phenotype. This 
phenotype is characterized by an advantageous ability to survive in a low-energy 
environment, resulting in reduced growth potential and muscle mass. Small size 
and low muscle mass lead to a decrease in basal metabolism, making it easier to 
accumulate excess energy as body fat. This differs fundamentally from the 
typical clinical presentation of obesity, which occurs in a state of energy 
excess. Our research focuses on two main areas: (1) investigating the increase 
in insulin resistance due to growth patterns and persistent reduction in lean 
body mass in preterm and low-birth-weight infants, and (2) studying the 
development of subcutaneous adipose tissue during the neonatal and infant 
periods, along with its associated metabolic and hormonal factors. In this 
review, we provide detailed insights into the mechanism by which sustained 
decrease in lean body mass and the development of lipid/fatty acid metabolism 
and adipose tissue during the fetal and neonatal periods may impact the onset of 
lifestyle-related diseases later in life.

Diabetic foot ulcers (DFU) are a common and severe complication among diabetic 
patients, posing a significant burden on patients' quality of life and 
healthcare systems due to their high incidence, amputation rates, and mortality. 
This study utilized single-cell RNA sequencing technology to deeply analyze the 
cellular heterogeneity of the skin on the feet ofDFU patients and the 
transcriptomic characteristics of endothelial cells, aiming to identify key cell 
populations and genes associated with the healing and progression of DFU. The 
study found that endothelial cells from DFU patients exhibited significant 
transcriptomic differences under various conditions, particularly in signaling 
pathways related to inflammatory responses and angiogenesis. Through trajectory 
analysis and cell communication research, we revealed the key role of 
endothelial cell subsets in the development of DFU and identified multiple 
important gene modules associated with the progression of DFU. Notably, the 
promoting effect of the SH3BGRL3 gene on endothelial cell proliferation, 
migration, and angiogenic capabilities under high glucose conditions was 
experimentally verified, providing a new potential target and theoretical basis 
for the treatment of DFU. This study not only enhances the understanding of the 
pathogenesis ofDFU but also provides a scientific basis for the development 
ofnew therapeutic strategies.

BACKGROUND: Research has shown that sedentary behavior (SB) may increase 
dementia risk, but it remains unclear whether concentrated moderate to vigorous 
physical activity (MVPA) can compensate such negative effects. This study aimed 
to explore the association between different MVPA patterns combined with SB time 
and the risk of dementia.
METHODS: This prospective study used data from the UK Biobank cohort, which 
provided accelerometer-based physical activity data for a full week from 
February 2013 to December 2015. Participants were categorized into "weekend 
warriors (WW)" group, engaged in more than 50% MVPA (≥ 150 min/week) on 1 to 2 
days; inactive group (total MVPA < 150 min/week); and regular group, who met the 
recommended MVPA (≥ 150 min/week) but not WW. The participants were further 
divided into six groups based on SB duration (≥ 8.52 h/day or < 8.52 h/day). A 
multivariable Cox model was used to assess the relationship between these 
patterns and the risk of dementia, adjusted by age, gender, ethnicity, Townsend 
deprivation index, education level, employment status, alcohol consumption, 
smoking, BMI, and baseline comorbidities (including cardiovascular disease, 
hypertension, and diabetes).
RESULTS: We included 91,948 participants without dementia at baseline. During a 
median follow-up of 7.93 years, 736 participants developed all-cause dementia. 
When the MVPA threshold was set at 150 min per week, 16,149 participants (17.5%) 
were classified as WW with long SB, 19,055 (20.7%) as regular with long SB, and 
21,909 (23.8%) as inactive with long SB. Compared to inactive and long SB time, 
the WW group showed a reduction in dementia risk (WW with long SB time: 
HR = 0.69, 95% CI: 0.54-0.87, P = 0.002; WW with short SB time: HR = 0.74, 95% 
CI: 0.56-0.97, P = 0.029). And regular group with shorter SB time was associated 
with a lower dementia risk (HR = 0.75, 95% CI: 0.59-0.96, P = 0.021), but not in 
the group with longer SB time.
CONCLUSIONS: The WW pattern may help mitigate the dementia risk associated with 
prolonged SB, suggesting that the quality and intensity of physical activity are 
also important factors.

BACKGROUND: Frailty is a syndrome as with aging in the population of type 2 
diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and exercise has become an essential 
non-pharmacological tool especially in the pre-frail stage. Notably, the form of 
supervised home-based exercise program has been strongly recommended in recent 
years. This study aimed to verify the potential effects of the supervised 
home-based elastic band exercise in pre-frail older T2DM patients in China.
METHODS: A total of 100 participants were included and randomly divided into 
intervention group (IG) (n = 50) and control group (CG) (n = 50). The CG 
received a routine care, while the IG received an extra home-based elastic band 
training under online and offline supervisions sustaining 12-weeks. The 
glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), blood lipids, body composition, physical 
function, scales of Diabetes specificity quality of life scale (DSQL), 
Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI) and short form geriatric depression scale 
(GDS-15) of the participants were evaluated before and after intervention.
RESULTS: The average age of the participants were 66.01 ± 4.76 with 55% male and 
average BMI 24.75 ± 3.51 kg/m2. The clinical characteristics of the two groups 
were comparable. After 12 weeks' training, muscle mass of the limbs (P < 0.05), 
physical function indicators including grip strength, chair stands (both 
P < 0.05), walking time (P < 0.01), HbA1c (P < 0.05), frailty score (P < 0.05), 
subjective sleep quality (P < 0.05), total DSQL scores (P < 0.01) and the 
depressive status (P < 0.01) improved significantly in IG when compared with CG.
CONCLUSION: Supervised home-based elastic band exercise could improve limb 
muscle mass, physical fitness, glucose and lipid control and quality of life in 
pre-frail older T2DM patients.

BACKGROUND: Dyslipidaemia is a significant risk factor for cardiovascular 
diseases, which can manifest early in life. Despite its importance, the 
prevalence of dyslipidaemia in the paediatric population of Pakistan remains 
poorly understood. This study uses laboratory data to determine the prevalence 
of dyslipidaemia and lipid testing practices among Pakistani children and 
adolescents.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study analysed the laboratory data from 
children and adolescents, aged up to 19 years, who underwent lipid testing. The 
data was obtained from two centres with collection points all over Pakistan for 
five years (March 2019-March 2024). Logistic regression models were used to 
assess relationships between demographic factors (age, sex and 
regions/provinces) and lipid profile parameters.
RESULTS: Over five years, 9,787 children and adolescents with a mean age of 
13.8 ± 5.1 years underwent lipid testing. Boys accounted for 59.7% of those 
tested compared to 40.3% of girls (p = 0.09). Most tests were conducted in 
Punjab (81.2%), with minimal representation from Balochistan (0.5%) and Gilgit 
Baltistan (0.3%). Among tested children and adolescents, 33.3% had elevated 
total cholesterol, 25.4% high low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, 46.6% low 
high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, 48.0% abnormal non- high-density 
lipoprotein cholesterol and 41.7% hypertriglyceridemia. Compared to boys, girls 
had significantly lower odds of abnormal high-density lipoprotein cholesterol 
(Odds Ratio 0.556, 95% CI 0.511-0.607, p < 0.001) and triglyceride levels (Odds 
Ratio 0.702, 95% CI 0.642-0.767, p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: This study highlights a high prevalence of dyslipidaemia among 
Pakistani children, with boys more affected than girls. The study also 
highlights a gender-based inequality in lipid testing where girls appear to be 
less frequently tested compared to boys.

PURPOSE: The purpose of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the effects of CKD on 
postoperative complications and the survival of patients with fractures.
METHODS: The PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and CNKI databases were searched 
from inception to May 15, 2024. The search strategy focused on two keywords: 
dialysis and hip fracture. Pooled odds ratios and mean differences were 
analyzed. RevMan 5.4 was used for data analysis in this meta-analysis.
RESULTS: This meta-analysis included 19 studies involving 1,615,440 patients. 
The CKD group had higher proportions of males, smokers, and patients with 
preoperative comorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, heart failure, 
chronic lung disease, coronary heart disease, peripheral vascular disease, 
dementia, and wound infection. The CKD group also had a greater likelihood of 
postoperative myocardial infarction (OR = 1.67, 95% CI = 1.54-1.81, P < 0.00001, 
I2 = 33%). There was no significant difference in cerebrovascular accidents, 
liver failure, sepsis, and overall complications between the two groups. 
Additionally, the CKD group had higher mortality rates at 30 days (OR = 2.71, 
95% CI = 2.23-3.28, P < 0.00001, I2 = 84%), 1 year (OR = 3.17, 95% 
CI = 2.64-3.82, P < 0.00001, I2 = 85%), 2 years (OR = 3.06, 95% CI = 2.88-3.25, 
P < 0.00001, I2 = 8%), and 10 years (OR = 6.85, 95% CI = 5.84-8.03, P < 0.00001, 
I2 = 0%) post-surgery compared to the non-CKD group.
CONCLUSION: Compared with patients in the non-CKD group, patients in the CKD 
group did not significantly differ in the incidence of most postoperative 
complications after fracture surgery. However, the CKD group had a significantly 
greater incidence of myocardial infarction and markedly higher postoperative 
mortality rates at 30 days, 1 year, 2 years, and 10 years.

BACKGROUND: Heart failure (HF) with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is 
increasingly prevalent worldwide due to aging and comorbidities. Epicardial 
adipose tissue (EAT), favored by diabetes and obesity, was shown to contribute 
to HFpEF pathophysiology and is an emerging therapeutic target. This study 
explored the relationship between ventricular EAT measured by cardiovascular 
magnetic resonance (CMR), metabolic factors, and imaging characteristics in 
controls, pre-HF patients, and HFpEF patients.
METHODS: Patients from a Belgian cohort enrolled from December 2015 to June 2017 
were categorized by HF stage: pre-HF (n = 16), HFpEF (n = 104) and compared to 
matched controls (n = 26) and to pre-HF (n = 191) from the Beta3-LVH cohort. 
Biventricular EAT volume was measured in end-diastolic short-axis cine stacks. 
In the Belgian cohort, associations between EAT, HF stage, and various 
biological and imaging markers were explored. The clinical endpoint was a 
composite of mortality or first HF hospitalization in the HFpEF group.
RESULTS: EAT significantly differed between groups, with higher values in HFpEF 
patients compared to pre-HF and controls (72.4 ± 20.8ml/m2vs. 55.0 ± 11.8ml/m2 
and 48 ± 8.9ml/m2, p < 0.001) from the Belgian cohort and to pre-HF (52.0 ± 15.0 
ml/m2, p < 0.001) from the Beta3-LVH cohort. Subsequent analyses focused on the 
Belgian cohort. In contrast to atrial fibrillation, diabetes prevalence and body 
mass index (BMI) did not differ between pre-HF and HFpEF patients. Multivariable 
logistic regression and random forest classification identified EAT, N-terminal 
pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), and H2FPEF score as strong markers 
of HFpEF status. EAT was significantly correlated with H2FPEF score (r = 0.41, 
p = 0.003), BMI (r = 0.30, p < 0.001), high-sensitive troponin T (r = 0.41, 
p < 0.001), NT-proBNP (r = 0.37, p < 0.001), soluble suppression of 
tumorigenicity-2 (sST2) (r = 0.30, p < 0.001), E/e' ratio (r = 0.33, p < 0.001), 
and left ventricular global longitudinal strain (r = 0.35, p < 0.001). In HFpEF 
patients, diabetes, ischemic cardiomyopathy, and elevated sST2 were 
independently associated with elevated EAT. In contrast with diabetes and BMI, 
increased EAT was not associated with prognosis.
CONCLUSIONS: EAT assessed by CMR was significantly higher in HFpEF patients 
compared to controls and pre-HF patients, irrespective of diabetes and BMI. EAT 
was moderately associated with HFpEF status. HFpEF patients with elevated EAT 
exhibited a marked diabetic, ischemic, and inflammatory profile, highlighting 
the potential role of drugs targeting EAT.

BACKGROUND: Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) are often 
underutilized in patients with heart failure (HF), particularly those with 
diabetes and/or chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, the impact of concurrent 
diabetes and CKD on the efficacy and safety of eplerenone in acute HF remains 
uncertain.
METHODS: The EARLIER trial enrolled patients with acute HF, who were randomized 
to receive eplerenone or placebo for 6 months. Patients were categorized based 
on the presence of diabetes and/or CKD (defined by eGFR < 45 ml/min/1.73 m2 or 
UACR ≥ 30 mg/g), and the associations between diabetes/CKD categories and 
cardiovascular outcomes were assessed. The effects of eplerenone on HF-related 
outcomes (i.e., cardiovascular death, HF hospitalization, worsening HF, or 
out-of-hospital diuretic intensification) and adverse events were also assessed 
across diabetes/CKD status.
RESULTS: Among 300 patients (mean age 67 ± 13 years; 73% male), 39% had 
diabetes, mean estimated glomerular filtration rate was 63 ± 18 ml/min/1.73 m2, 
median urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio was 34 mg/g (13-84 mg/g), and 58% had 
CKD. Patients with both diabetes and CKD (26%) had a higher risk of 
cardiovascular death and/or hospitalization compared to those without either 
disease (HR, 95% CI = 2.57, 1.29-5.12; P = 0.007, P-for-interaction = 0.049), 
and poor prognosis persisted after adjusting for covariates (i.e., natriuretic 
peptide) (adjusted-HR, 95% CI = 2.33, 1.12-4.84; P = 0.02). Furthermore, the 
effects of eplerenone on HF-related outcomes and adverse events were consistent 
regardless of diabetes/CKD categories (all-P-for interaction > 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with acute HF, the combination of diabetes and CKD was 
associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events. However, the 
efficacy and safety of eplerenone were not influenced by diabetes and CKD 
status.

BACKGROUND: Recurrent/metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma 
(R/M-HNSCC) is a severe, frequently lethal condition. Oncogene addiction to 
epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a hallmark of HNSCC, but the clinical 
efficacy of EGFR-targeted therapies remains low. Understanding molecular 
networks governing EGFR-driven progression is paramount to the exploration of 
(co)-treatment targets and predictive markers.
METHODS: We performed function-based mapping of differentially expressed genes 
in EGFR-mediated local invasion (fDEGs) using photoconvertible tracers and 
RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) in a cellular 3D-model.
RESULTS: Upon alignment with public single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) datasets and 
HNSCC-specific regulons, a gene regulatory network of local invasion (invGRN) 
was inferred from gene expression data, which was overrepresented in budding 
tumors. InvGRN comprises the central hubs inhibin subunit beta alpha (INHBA) and 
snail family transcriptional repressor 2 (SNAI2), and druggable fDEGs integrin 
subunit beta 4 (ITGB4), laminin 5 (LAMB3/LAMC2), and sphingosine kinase 1 
(SPHK1). Blockade of INHBA repressed local invasion and was reverted by activin 
A, laminin 5, and sphingosine-1-phosphate, demonstrating a functional 
interconnectivity of the invGRN. Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of 
malignant cells and the invGRN are induced by newly defined EGFR-activity 
subtypes with prognostic value that are promoted by amphiregulin (AREG) and 
epiregulin (EREG). Importantly, co-inhibition of SPHK1 showed synthetic effects 
on Cetuximab-mediated invasion blockade and high expression of selected fDEGs 
was associated with response to Cetuximab in patient-derived xenotransplantation 
(PDX) and R/M-HNSCC patients.
CONCLUSIONS: We describe an actionable network of EGFR-mediated local invasion 
and define druggable effectors with predictive potential regarding the response 
of R/M-HNSCC to Cetuximab.

BACKGROUND: A high consumption of ultra-processed foods (UPFs) has been related 
to several chronic diseases such as obesity and type 2 diabetes. This study 
aimed to estimate the proportion of the burden of obesity and type 2 diabetes in 
Belgium that could be attributed to the consumption of UPFs.
METHODS: A comparative-risk assessment framework was used. A literature search 
and a dose-response meta-analysis between UPFs intake and obesity and type 2 
diabetes were performed. The risks were extracted from the curve dose-response 
meta-analysis and extrapolated to the mean of UPFs consumption by strata (5-year 
age category/sex/region) using the 2014/2015 Belgian Food Consumption Survey. 
The population attributable fraction and the attributable burden were then 
calculated for the prevalence of obesity and type 2 diabetes, and 
disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) for type 2 diabetes.
RESULTS: From the meta-analysis, for every 10% increase in UPFs intake (g/day), 
there was a 13% increase in risk of developing type 2 diabetes (RR:1.13, 95%IC 
1.12-1.15, p<0.001) and for every 10% increase of energy intake from UPFs 
(kcal/day), there was a 5% increase in risk of developing obesity (RR:1.05, 
95%IC 0.99-1.13, p=0.1321). Using these estimates, 21% of cases (277 056/1 286 
454) of obesity in Belgium in 2014/2015 could be attributed to the UPFs intake. 
Similarly, for type 2 diabetes in Belgium in 2014/2015, 23% of cases (53 348/227 
502) and 24% of DALYs (7 998/34 034) were attributed to UPFs consumption.
CONCLUSIONS: The sizeable impact of UPFs on the burden of obesity and type 2 
diabetes in Belgium emphasizes the need to design and implement policies to

BACKGROUND: Patient decision aids (PDAs) can effectively facilitate shared 
decision-making (SDM) between patients and healthcare professionals. The 
International Patient Decision Aid Standards (IPDAS) Collaboration created a 
model for the systematic development of PDAs. However, the absence of a solid 
evidence base limits practical recommendations for best practices. For example, 
uncertainties exist about the most appropriate method for identifying the needs 
and preferences of patients and healthcare professionals. This study aims to 
detail the development process for the development of a PDA for type 2 diabetes 
mellitus (T2DM), using the IPDAS model.
METHODS: From September 2020 to February 2023, we systematically developed the 
PDA for T2DM in the Netherlands. We adopted a patient-centered approach by 
researching patient considerations and actively collaborating with a 
multidisciplinary steering group, including patients with T2DM, patient 
organizations, and healthcare professionals. The PDA content and prototype 
development were determined by incorporating patients' needs and preferences, 
input from the steering group, and available evidence regarding T2DM treatment 
options. The research team and steering group iteratively reviewed the PDA 
prototype.
RESULTS: A web-based PDA was developed consisting of five sections: 1) 
information about T2DM and the available treatment options; 2) comparison of 
treatment options; 3) questions to assess patients' knowledge; 4) 
value-clarification exercise; and 5) summary of the patient's journey through 
the PDA. Before patients use the PDA, healthcare professionals can preselect the 
most relevant treatment options.
CONCLUSIONS: Early and iterative involvement of relevant stakeholders in the 
development process of the PDA helped the alignment of the PDA with the needs 
and preferences of the diverse end-users. In a future study, we will investigate 
the effectiveness of the PDA in facilitating SDM in T2DM care.

BACKGROUND: Globally, the number of individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus 
(T2DM) is increasing, and they are at a higher risk of developing mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI) than the general population. Sleep quality is thought to be a 
modifiable factor that may contribute to MCI, as previous studies have linked it 
to cognitive function in older adults. However, evidence concerning the 
association between sleep quality and MCI among patients with T2DM in China is 
limited. Therefore, this study aims to identify the association between sleep 
quality and MCI among patients with T2DM in China.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted among patients with T2DM who 
were referred to the Endocrinology Department of Xiangya Hospital, Central South 
University. Data regarding sociodemographic characteristics, lifestyle factors, 
T2DM-related information, and biochemical indicators were collected. Sleep 
quality and MCI were evaluated using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) 
and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scale, respectively. The 
association between sleep quality and MCI was analyzed using univariate and 
multivariate analyses.
RESULTS: This study included 1,001 patients with T2DM, with a mean age of 60.2 
(standard deviation: 10.1) years. Pearson's correlation analysis showed that the 
total PSQI score was negatively associated with the MMSE score (r=-0.27, 
P < 0.05). Multivariate analyses based on four models consistently showed that 
those with higher total PSQI score (aOR = 1.09-1.11, P < 0.05), as well as 
higher scores on the subjective sleep quality (aOR = 1.32-1.46, P < 0.05), sleep 
latency (aOR = 1.25-1.32, P < 0.05), sleep duration (aOR = 1.30-1.32, P < 0.05), 
sleep efficiency (aOR = 1.36-1.41, P < 0.05), sleep disturbance 
(aOR = 1.66-1.86, P < 0.05), and daily dysfunction (aOR = 1.38-1.48, P < 0.05) 
were associated with higher rates of MCI.
CONCLUSIONS: Among Chinese patients with T2DM, poor overall sleep quality, 
subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, sleep efficiency, sleep 
disturbance, and daily dysfunction were associated with higher rates of MCI. 
Future studies are needed to examine whether sleep intervention could improve 
cognitive function in patients with T2DM. It is also suggested for clinicians 
working with T2DM patients to raise the awareness of cognitive impairment and 
sleep problems.

Tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) and immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) 
combination therapy is emerging as a major therapeutic strategy for advanced 
clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). To define the druggable targets for 
improvement of TKI and ICI combination therapy in ccRCC, we analyzed a 
commercial protein kinase inhibitor dataset and a public ccRCC dataset and 
identified LRRK2 as a potential candidate that can be targeted by a small 
molecule inhibitor. We demonstrated that LRRK2 was transcriptionally upregulated 
by HIF2A and enabled to drive proliferation of ccRCC cells in a manner 
independent of its kinase activity. LRRK2 inhibits the RBX1-mediated degradation 
of lipid metabolism modulator LPCAT1 to reducing the sensitivity to TKI and PD-1 
blockade in ccRCC. Specifically, LRRK2/LPCAT1 upregulated IL-1β expression 
levels through AKT and also increased IL-1β shearing by activating inflammasome. 
To target the kinase-independent activity of LRRK2, we developed an LR-protac 
and showed that LR-protac decreased LRRK2 protein level and enhanced the 
antitumor effect of PD-1 blockade and TKI in ccRCC. These data indicate that 
LRRK2 is a viable target for improvement of the efficacy of PD-1 blockade and 
TKI in ccRCC.

OBJECTIVES: The relationship between gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and 
primary acquired nasolacrimal duct obstruction (PANDO) remains underexplored, 
and large-scale global studies are lacking. This study aims to evaluate the 
association between GERD and PANDO on an international scale.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study utilized data from the TriNetX Global 
Collaborative Network, encompassing over 157 million patients across 18 
countries. Patients with GERD and controls without GERD were included from 
January, 2004, through November, 2024. Patients with pre-existing lacrimal 
passage disorders were excluded. The primary outcome was the incidence of PANDO. 
Patients were followed for up to 20 years. Propensity score matching was 
employed to balance baseline characteristics. Cox proportional hazards 
regression was used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs), and Kaplan-Meier analysis 
was conducted to assess the cumulative incidence.
RESULTS: After matching, 876,330 patients were included in both the GERD and 
control cohorts. GERD was associated with a significantly higher risk of PANDO 
(HR: 2.49; 95% CI: 2.18-2.85; P < 0.001). Risk stratification analyses 
demonstrated greater risks in females (HR: 2.74; 95% CI: 2.32-3.24) and in older 
age groups (HR for ≥60 years: 3.12; 95% CI: 2.59-3.74). Comorbidities such as 
diabetes, dyslipidaemia, hypertension, ischemic heart disease, chronic kidney 
disease, and sinusitis further increased the risk of PANDO.
CONCLUSIONS: GERD increases the risk of PANDO, particularly in females, older 
adults, and patients with cardiovascular comorbidities or sinusitis. Clinicians 
should educate GERD patients about the potential risk of PANDO and arrange 
referrals when necessary.

OBJECTIVE: Characterize changes in neonatal energy metabolism hormones in first 
postnatal week.
STUDY DESIGN: Concentrations of leptin, adiponectin, insulin, resistin, and 
ghrelin were measured in cord and infant blood collected in the first postnatal 
week in a prospective cohort of term and preterm infants. Change over time in 
each hormone was modeled using linear mixed effects regression.
RESULT: Among 106 infants, 65 (61%) were preterm and 44 (42%) were exposed to 
diabetes (DM) in pregnancy. DM group had higher leptin [between group difference 
β 2.5 (95%CI: 1.72-3.70)] and resistin [β 1.5 (95%CI:1.14, 1.92)] and lower 
ghrelin [β 0.49] [95%CI: (0.32-0.76)] versus non-DM group. Preterm infants had 
lower adiponectin [β 0.80 (95%CI: 0.67-0.96)] versus term group. Insulin varied 
by DM and prematurity (interaction-term p value < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: In this cohort, hormone concentrations varied by DM and prematurity. 
Early alterations in energy metabolism hormones may reflect changes in 
developmental programming which persist in the early postnatal period.

The cardiometabolic index (CMI), which integrates individual lipid and visceral 
fat parameters, represents a superior new predictive tool for cardiovascular and 
metabolic disorders, but its predictive value for gallstones (GS) is unclear. 
Therefore, the present study used this vacancy to explore the relationship 
between CMI levels and GS in US adults, assess the mediating role of diabetes 
mellitus in the pathogenesis of both, and provide new clinical ideas for early 
prevention and screening of GS in patients with diabetes mellitus. This survey 
extracted information from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 
(NHANES) 2017-2020 vintage cycle. Cross-sectional analyses and a variety of 
statistical techniques were used to analyze the correlation between CMI and GS, 
including logistic regression, propensity score matching, subject work curves, 
and restricted cubic spline (RCS). Furthermore, mediation analysis was used to 
investigate whether and to what extent diabetes mediated the effect of CMI on 
GS. After analysis of 3,395 participants, a significant positive correlation was 
observed between elevated CMI levels and increased prevalence of GS In the fully 
corrected model (Model 4), the prevalence of GS exhibited a 23% increase for 
every incremental unit rise in logarithmically transformed CM. Mediation 
analysis showed that diabetes largely mediated the association between CMI and 
GS, with a mediation ratio of 15.1%. Higher CMI levels are closely linked to a 
greater occurrence of GS, and diabetes plays a key mediating role in the 
pathogenesis of both. Addressing dyslipidemia while not neglecting blood glucose 
levels, and co-management of the two may be a proven way to reduce GS risk.

Norepinephrine (NE) is mainly released by sympathetic nerve terminals to act on 
organs and tissues. After corneal epithelial debridement, we found that the 
sympathetic nerve fibers penetrated the limbus and regenerated toward the cornea 
within 24 h post-wounding. Topical NE application recapitulated the 
characteristics of delayed corneal epithelial wound healing and nerve 
regeneration in healthy mice, accompanied by the partial depletion of multiple 
neurotrophins, such as nerve growth factor and glial cell-derived nerve growth 
factor. Moreover, the diabetes mellitus (DM) mice exhibited corneal sensory 
nerve dysfunction and increased plasma and corneal NE contents, which were 
rescued by 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) and bretylium. In the cell culture model, 
the conditioned medium of NE-treated corneal epithelial cells inhibited 
trigeminal ganglion (TG) neurite outgrowth, which was reversed by the β2 
adrenergic receptor (ADRB2) antagonist, but not by the β1 adrenergic receptor 
(ADRB1) antagonist. Topical application of the ADRB2 antagonist recovered the 
expression of corneal neurotrophins, and promoted corneal epithelial and nerve 
regeneration in DM mice. Taken together, the NE-ADRB2 axis regulates corneal 
neurotrophin expression and nerve regeneration in mice. Topical application of 
the ADRB2 antagonist may represent a promising therapeutic strategy for diabetic 
corneal sensory nerve dysfunction.

Considering the global incidence of diabetes, developing new compounds to lower 
blood sugar levels has become increasingly crucial. As a result, there has been 
a growing focus on the synthesis of α-glucosidase inhibitors in recent years. 
This study investigated design, synthesis, and effects of novel 5-aryl 
pyrazole-glucose hybrids as α-glucosidase inhibitors. Thirteen derivatives from 
this class of compounds were synthesized, demonstrating superior in vitro 
inhibitory effects (IC50 values ranging from 0.5 to 438.6 µM, compared to 
acarbose at 750.0 µM). Among them, compound 8g (IC50 = 0.5 µM) was selected for 
further investigations and the kinetic studies revealed that it is a competitive 
inhibitor (Ki = 0.46 µM). Fluorescence assays indicated changes in the 
fluorescence intensity, while thermodynamic analyses suggested that compound 8g 
promoted a transition of the enzyme into an unfolded state. Furthermore, in vivo 
studies demonstrated that 8g effectively reduced blood sugar levels in rats at 
doses comparable to acarbose. Molecular docking studies revealed that this 
compound interacted with the enzyme's active site, and molecular dynamics 
simulations showed that pharmacophores engaged in various interactions with the 
enzyme.

5-hydroxymethylcytosine, also known as the sixth DNA base of the genome, plays 
an important role in brain aging and neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's 
disease. However, little is known about its genome-wide distribution and its 
association with Alzheimer's disease pathology. Here, we report a genome-wide 
profiling of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine in 1079 autopsied brains (dorsolateral 
prefrontal cortex) of older individuals and assess its association with multiple 
measures of Alzheimer's disease pathologies, including pathological diagnosis of 
Alzheimer's disease, amyloid-β load, and PHFtau tangle density. Of 197,765 
5-hydroxymethylcytosine regions detected, we identified 2821 differentially 
hydroxymethylated regions associated with Alzheimer's disease neuropathology 
after controlling for multiple testing and covariates. Many differentially 
hydroxymethylated regions are located within known Alzheimer's disease loci, 
such as RIN3, PLCG2, ITGA2B, and USP6NL. Integrative multi-omics analyses 
support a potential mechanistic role of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine alterations in 
Alzheimer's disease. Our study presents a large-scale genome-wide atlas of 
5-hydroxymethylcytosine in Alzheimer's brain and offers insight into the 
mechanism underlying Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis.

Here, we present StimExo as a rational design strategy allowing various 
user-defined control signals to trigger calcium-dependent exocytosis and mediate 
on-demand protein secretion in cell-therapy settings. Using a modular framework 
incorporating inducible protein-protein interactions into an engineered 
bipartite activator of calcium release-activated calcium (CRAC) channels, Ca2+ 
influx mediated by the STIM/Orai1 machinery was flexibly adjusted to depend on 
different user-defined input signals. Application of StimExo to various 
endocrine cells enables instant secretion of therapeutic hormones upon 
administration of safe and patient-compliant trigger compounds. StimExo also 
mediated insulin exocytosis using a cell-based gene delivery strategy in vivo, 
accounting for real-time control of blood glucose homeostasis in male diabetic 
mice in response to the FDA-approved drug grazoprevir. This study achieves true 
"sense-and-respond" cell-based therapies and provides a platform for remote 
control of in vivo transgene activities using various trigger signals of 
interest.

BACKGROUND: CFTR modulators in post-transplant people with cystic fibrosis 
(pwCF) are less frequently used due to uncertainty regarding effectiveness and 
interactions with immunosuppressive agents. Elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor 
(ETI) is a triple combination cystic fibrosis (CF) therapeutic with benefits in 
multiple organ systems where complications can impact lung transplant (LTx) 
outcomes, including malnutrition, diabetes, and sinus disease. ETI use in LTx 
recipients is variable.
METHODS: We conducted a pharmacokinetics (PK) study of concentrations of ETI 
parent compounds and the four major metabolites (M23-ELX, M1-TEZ, M1-IVA, 
M6-IVA) in a prospective non-randomized observational study, with all transplant 
participants concomitantly taking tacrolimus for LTx immunosuppression and 
excluded if taking any other medication with known interactions (e.g., azole 
antifungals) and compared to a non-transplant group of pwCF. We completed 
non-compartmental analysis (NCA) for both groups and compared the transplant to 
non-transplant PK parameters, as well as to published data from the manufacturer 
for non-transplant pwCF. Area under the curve (AUC), average concentrations 
(Cavg), minimum and maximum concentrations, clearance, and other parameters were 
determined.
RESULTS: Twelve transplant and fourteen non-transplant participants with CF 
completed the study. There were no significant differences between the mean 
values for any PK parameters for the transplant and non-transplant groups and no 
substantial differences in frequency of concentrations outside the therapeutic 
ranges in the two groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest there are not significant differences in 
concentrations of ELX, TEZ, IVA, or their major human metabolites in LTx 
recipients compared to non-transplant pwCF.

BACKGROUND: Multimorbidity, defined as two or more chronic conditions in an 
individual, is increasing in prevalence and is associated with polypharmacy. 
Polypharmacy can lead to increased out-of-pocket payments for prescription 
medicines. This, in turn, can be associated with cost-related non-adherence and 
impoverishment. Healthcare in Denmark is mostly free at the point-of-use; 
prescription medicines are one of the only exceptions.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between multimorbidity and annual 
out-of-pocket prescription medicine expenditure for adults in Denmark.
METHODS: A population-based register study was conducted. The study population 
included all adults residing in Denmark in 2020. Frequencies and descriptive 
statistics were used and regression analyses were conducted to assess the 
association between multimorbidity and annual out-of-pocket prescription 
medicine expenditure, while controlling for demographic and socioeconomic 
covariates.
RESULTS: Overall, 1,212,033 (24.2 %) individuals had multimorbidity. Individuals 
with five or more conditions spent, on average, €320 in out-of-pocket 
prescription medicines expenditure compared to €187 for those with two 
conditions and €44 for those with no conditions. Amongst those with any 
out-of-pocket prescription medicine expenditure, having multimorbidity was 
associated with 2-4 times greater out-of-pocket prescription medicine 
expenditure than those with zero conditions. Amongst those in the quantile with 
the highest expenditure, those with five or more conditions spent €408 more than 
those with no conditions, and those with two conditions spent €185 more than 
those with no conditions.
CONCLUSIONS: For adults in Denmark, multimorbidity was associated with 
significantly higher out-of-pocket prescription medicine expenditure, even after 
controlling for demographic and socioeconomic covariates. This is similar to 
patterns in other countries and likely affects those with lowest income the 
most, given the known socioeconomic patterning of multimorbidity, and raises 
concerns about cost related non-adherence. Potential protective mechanisms could 
include subsidies for certain vulnerable patient groups (e.g. those with severe 
mental illness) and low-income groups.

RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: Pancreatic imaging biomarkers on CT imaging are known 
to be associated with diabetes. However, no studies have examined if these 
imaging biomarkers are resilient to changes in segmentation quality and contrast 
status. Here, we assess if imaging biomarkers are robust to variations in 
pancreatic segmentation quality and contrast status, and how these factors 
affect their ability to predict diabetes.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study selected patients with CT scans 
and corresponding HbA1c tests from two institutions. Patients were classified 
into two categories: having diabetes at the time or < 4 years after the scan 
(diabetic/incident) vs not having diabetes within 4 years after the scan 
(nondiabetic). Pancreatic imaging biomarkers, including average attenuation, 
intrapancreatic fat fraction, fractal dimension of the pancreatic boundary and 
volume, were measured using three pancreatic segmentation algorithms 
(TotalSegmentator, nnU-Net, and DM-UNet). Pairwise comparisons were made between 
algorithms when computing pancreatic imaging biomarker values for all patient 
scans. Predictive ability of imaging biomarkers (derived from each algorithm) 
was assessed for agreement between algorithms using a generalized additive 
model.
RESULTS: A total of 9772 patients (age, 56.1 years ± 9.1 [SD]; 5407 females) 
were included in this study. Imaging biomarkers based on attenuation 
measurements showed high algorithm agreement (ICC ≥0.93), with lower agreement 
on measures not reliant on attenuation. Models trained on imaging biomarkers 
derived from these algorithms exhibited good predictive agreement (AUC for 
diabetes overall, 0.84-0.91; contrast scans, 0.73-0.80; noncontrast scans, 
0.62-0.80). Algorithms achieved a positive predictive value of 0.79-0.84, and 
negative predictive value of 0.89-0.94.
CONCLUSION: Attenuation-based imaging biomarkers demonstrated robustness to 
segmentation algorithm quality and consistent predictive ability across 
different clinical scenarios. These findings suggest that CT-derived biomarkers 
could be a reliable tool for diabetes screening across multiple institutions.

BACKGROUND: Guideline concordance is associated with improved patient outcomes. 
Accurately quantifying the concordance between provided care and guideline 
recommendations offers valuable insights into the alignment of care with 
established guidelines and supports proactive approaches for improving the 
quality of care. Traditional models for calculating guideline concordance are 
effective in assessing clinical performance via cohort averages. However, these 
models fail at the individual patient level by not accounting for past clinical 
activities and their timing, which may give a distorted impression of the actual 
alignment between guideline recommendations and received care.
OBJECTIVES: To develop a model for evaluating guideline concordance that 
provides accurate concordance scores at the individual patient level.
METHODS: The newly developed ratio model incorporates past clinical activities 
and their timing (ie, past clinical trajectories), resulting in accurate, 
patient-centred concordance scores. We discuss its advantages and limitations 
and showcase its performance using clinical indicators for patients with type 2 
diabetes mellitus.
RESULTS: The ratio model demonstrates enhanced precision in evaluating guideline 
concordance at the individual level and better reflects the clinical trajectory 
of individual patients. While primarily designed to produce accurate individual 
patient scores, the model is also effective for assessing clinical performance 
through cohort averages. The ratio model is adaptable to diverse clinical 
contexts requiring regular follow-up, including chronic disease management, 
vaccination programmes, cancer surveillance and routine health screenings.
CONCLUSIONS: The ratio model provides accurate and patient-centred guideline 
concordance scores. The model's enhanced precision at the individual level 
creates opportunities for research and clinical applications, including 
integration into clinical decision support systems.

OBJECTIVE: Carriers of PAM (peptidylglycine alpha-amidating monooxygenase) 
coding variant alleles have reduced insulinogenic index, higher risk of 
developing type 2 diabetes (T2D), and islets from heterozygous carriers of the 
PAM p.Asp563Gly variant display reduced insulin secretion. Exactly how global 
PAM deficiency contributes to hyperglycemia remains unclear. PAM is the only 
enzyme capable of converting glycine-extended peptide hormones into amidated 
products. Like neuropeptide Y (NPY), α-melanocyte stimulating hormone (αMSH), 
and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP), a beta 
cell peptide that forms islet amyloid in type 2 diabetes, is a PAM substrate. We 
hypothesized that Pam deficiency limited to beta cells would lead to reduced 
insulin secretion, prevent the production of amidated IAPP, and reveal the 
extent to which loss of Pam in β-cells could accelerate the onset of 
hyperglycemia in mice.
METHODS: PAM activity was assessed in human islets from donors based on their 
PAM genotype. We generated beta cell-specific Pam knockout (Ins1Cre/+, Pamfl/fl; 
βPamKO) mice and performed islet culture, histological, and metabolic assays to 
evaluate the physiological roles of Pam in beta cells. We analyzed human IAPP 
(hIAPP) amyloid fibril forming kinetics using synthetic amidated and 
non-amidated hIAPP peptides, and generated hIAPP knock-in beta cell-specific Pam 
knockout (hIAPPw/w βPamKO) mice to determine the impact of hIAPP amidation on 
islet amyloid burden, islet graft survival, and glucose tolerance.
RESULTS: PAM enzyme activity was significantly reduced in islets from donors 
with the PAM p.Asp563Gly T2D-risk allele. Islets from βPamKO mice had impaired 
second-phase glucose- and KCl- induced insulin secretion. Beta cells from βPamKO 
mice had larger dense-core granules and fewer and shorter cilia. Interestingly, 
non-amidated hIAPP was less fibrillogenic in vitro, and high glucose-treated 
hIAPPw/w βPamKO islets had reduced amyloid burden. Despite these changes in beta 
cell function, βPamKO mice were not more susceptible to diet-induced 
hyperglycemia. In vitro beta cell death and in vivo islet graft survival 
remained comparable between hIAPPw/w βPamKO and hIAPPw/w islets. Surprisingly, 
aged hIAPPw/w βPamKO mice had improved insulin secretion and glucose tolerance.
CONCLUSIONS: Eliminating Pam expression only in beta cells leads to 
morphological changes in insulin granules, reduced insulin secretion, reduced 
hIAPP amyloid burden and altered ciliogenesis. However, in mice beta-cell Pam 
deficiency has no impact on the development of diet- or hIAPP-induced 
hyperglycemia. Our data are consistent with current studies revealing ancient, 
highly conserved roles for peptidergic signaling in the coordination of the 
diverse signals needed to regulate fundamental processes such as glucose 
homeostasis.

BACKGROUND: Fasting blood glucose (FBG) is a significant risk factor for 
in-hospital mortality in acute coronary syndrome (ACS). This study examines the 
relationship between FBG levels and outcomes in ACS patients with different 
glycemic statuses.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Data from 50,365 ACS patients in the CCC-ACS Project 
(2014-2019) were analyzed in a prospective cohort study. Patients were 
categorized into three groups based on diabetes history and HbA1c levels: Group 
A (good), Group B (intermediate), and Group C (poor) glycemic status. A 
non-linear relationship between FBG and mortality was found. The lowest 
mortality risks were associated with FBG levels of 4.96 mmol/L (Group A), 
5.71 mmol/L (Group B), and 7.44 mmol/L (Group C). Elevated FBG levels were 
linked to increased mortality risk in all groups: Group A (OR: 1.17), Group B 
(OR: 1.14), and Group C (OR: 1.10), all p < 0.001. The model showed moderate 
accuracy (AUC: 0.78 for Groups A/B, 0.80 for Group C)·In Group A, each unit 
increase in FBG raised the mortality risk by 1.08 times compared to Group B (OR: 
1.08, 95 % CI: 1.03-1.14, p = 0.002) and by 1.07 times compared to Group C (OR: 
1.07, 95 % CI: 1.03-1.12, p = 0.002).
CONCLUSIONS: In ACS patients, elevated FBG is an independent risk factor for 
in-hospital mortality, regardless of glycemic status. Different glycemic 
statuses have varied optimal glycemic targets. The effect of FBG on mortality 
differs across glycemic groups, with patients in good glycemic status facing the 
highest mortality risk as FBG increases.

AIMS: To examine the isotemporal substitution association of replacing 
moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) with other behaviors on the 
prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) among Chinese adults with type 2 
diabetes mellitus (T2DM) METHODS: This study included 5421 adults with T2DM from 
the National Metabolic Management Centre Ningbo Branch. Data on physical 
activity, sedentary behavior, and sleep were collected using a standardized 
questionnaire through face-to-face interviews. Isotemporal substitution models 
were employed to evaluate the associations of reallocating time from other 
behaviors to MVPA with the risk of CKD.
RESULTS: Substitution of 30 min per day of sleeping or sitting with MVPA was 
associated with a lower CKD prevalence (OR: 0.87 for sleep substitution; 0.90 
for sitting substitution). Among individuals with inadequate MVPA levels (less 
than 150 min per week), the association of replacing 30 min of sleeping, 
sitting, or low-intensity physical activity with MVPA was particularly strong, 
cutting the risk of CKD by more than 60%. Stratified analysis among participants 
with inadequate MVPA revealed that the association of reallocating time to MVPA 
with lower CKD prevalence were predominantly observed among men, individuals 
with prolonged sleep duration (sleep duration more than 7.5 h per day), and 
those with better glycemic control (HbA1c levels below 7%).
CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed that replacing sleep or sedentary time with 
MVPA was associated with a lower prevalence of CKD among Chinese adults with 
T2DM, especially those with low MVPA. Incorporating MVPA into daily routines is 
potentially beneficial for improving renal health in people with T2DM.

In advanced atherosclerotic lesions, macrophage apoptosis contributes to plaque 
progression and the formation of necrotic cores, rendering plaques vulnerable to 
rupture. The pro-apoptotic protein Bim plays a crucial role in mediating 
apoptosis in macrophages under prolonged endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. 
High-density lipoprotein (HDL) has been shown to suppress macrophage apoptosis 
induced by ER stressors. To investigate the impact of apolipoprotein A1 (ApoA1) 
deficiency, associated with reduced HDL levels, on necrotic core growth and 
plaque apoptosis, we introduced ApoA1 deficiency into low-density lipoprotein 
receptor (LDLR) knockout mice and fed them a high-fat diet for 10 weeks. 
ApoA1-deficient LDLR knockout mice developed advanced plaques characterized by 
large necrotic cores, increased apoptosis, and elevated Bim expression in 
macrophages within the plaques. To assess whether deletion of Bim could mitigate 
this development, mice underwent bone marrow transplantation with bone marrow 
from either Bim-deficient mice or from mice with a deletion of myeloid-derived 
Bim driven by LyzM-cre. Inhibiting Bim in all bone marrow-derived cells led to 
leukocytosis, reductions in plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels, and 
decreased plaque apoptosis, necrotic core, and plaque sizes in ApoA1 and LDLR 
double-knockout mice but not in LDLR knockout mice. Likewise, conditional 
deletion of Bim in the myeloid compartment of ApoA1 and LDLR double-knockout 
mice also reduced apoptosis, necrotic core sizes, and plaque sizes, without 
inducing leukocytosis or lowering plasma cholesterol levels. These findings 
suggest that ApoA1 deficiency triggers apoptosis in myeloid cells through a 
Bim-dependent pathway, significantly contributing to the development of necrotic 
cores and the progression of atherosclerotic plaques.

Hypotony maculopathy is a potential complication of glaucoma filtering surgery, 
clinically relevant as it can cause vision loss. Classically, it produces 
choroidal folds, vascular tortuosity, and optic disc edema. However, in optical 
coherence tomography (OCT), it may also present as intraretinal cysts (IRC). We 
present the case of a patient who, 10 years after undergoing glaucoma surgery, 
developed ocular hypotony, IRC, and decreased visual acuity (VA). Given the 
patient's history of diabetes mellitus, it was initially diagnosed as diabetic 
macular edema (DME), which delayed appropriate treatment. This led to worsening 
corneal decompensation, ultimately requiring a corneal transplant in the form of 
Descemet membrane endothelial keratoplasty (DMEK).

BACKGROUND: Coronary artery disease (CAD) and atrial fibrillation (AF) 
contribute significantly to global mortality and frequently co-exist due to 
shared risk factors like hypertension and diabetes. This study seeks to explore 
the relatively overlooked area of mortality patterns among adults who have both 
coronary artery disease and atrial fibrillation.
METHODS: Mortality data for individuals aged ≥25 were obtained from CDC WONDER 
using ICD-10 codes I20-25 (CAD) and I48 (AF). Age-adjusted mortality rates 
(AAMR) and crude mortality rates per 100,000 were calculated. Trends were 
analyzed by gender, year, race, urbanization, and state. JoinPoint regression 
estimated annual percent change (APC) and average annual percent change (AAPC) 
with 95% confidence intervals (CI).
RESULTS: From 1999 to 2022, there were 942,461 recorded deaths among individuals 
with CAD and AF in the United States. The AAMR rose from 14.35 in 1999 to 24.53 
in 2022, resulting in an AAPC of 2.56* (95% CI, 2.24 - 2.85). The AAMR showed a 
consistent increase throughout the study period, with a significant spike from 
2018 to 2022 (APC: 6.87*; 95% CI, 4.82 - 10.66). Men consistently had higher 
AAMRs than women. Non-Hispanic (NH) White individuals reported the highest AAMR, 
followed by NH Black, Hispanic, and NH other populations. Nonmetropolitan areas 
exhibited higher AAMR than metropolitan regions.
CONCLUSION: AAMR showed a moderate rise from 1999-2018, followed by a sharp 
increase from 2018-2022, possibly linked to COVID-19. Further research is needed 
to understand contributing factors.

Kidney transplantation is the optimal treatment for end-stage kidney disease, 
but many patients also have diabetes mellitus. This study compares long-term 
outcomes between new users of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) 
and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP-4i) in kidney transplant recipients 
with diabetes mellitus. Data from the TriNetX Collaborative Network, including 
89,710 patients with diabetes mellitus who underwent kidney transplantation 
between January 1, 2015, and June 30, 2023, were analyzed. From this cohort, 
1,410 matched pairs of SGLT2i and DPP-4i users were selected based on propensity 
scores. The results showed that SGLT2i users had a lower risk of dialysis (HR: 
0.694) and all-cause mortality (HR: 0.687) compared to DPP-4i users. There were 
no significant differences in the risk of post-transplant infections, transplant 
rejection, or hospitalization between the two groups. Additionally, SGLT2i users 
had significantly lower cumulative incidences of dialysis and mortality. In 
conclusion, this study, utilizing data from TriNetX, demonstrates that SGLT2i 
treatment in kidney transplant recipients with diabetes mellitus is associated 
with lower risks of dialysis and mortality, suggesting it may help preserve 
kidney function and improve survival in this population.

Serious symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 complications are 
particular concerns for people with multiple sclerosis, especially those 
receiving immunosuppressants or immunomodulators. Studies have aimed to identify 
individuals with multiple sclerosis who are at high risk for SARS-CoV-2 
infection, to analyse the interplay between SARS-CoV-2 and multiple sclerosis 
and to evaluate immunological responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccines. 
The emergence of evolving dominant SARS-CoV-2 variants, a range of available 
vaccines, and novel therapeutic approaches requires that clinical neurologists 
be regularly updated with the latest information. Unresolved issues include 
optimisation of vaccination strategies to enhance vaccine efficacy and the 
management of patients who do not show seroconversion post vaccination. Tailored 
vaccination has the potential to improve patient care, and future studies should 
focus on evaluating novel therapies and preventive measures while constantly 
updating our knowledge of potential SARS-CoV-2 variants, in preparation for 
future outbreaks or pandemics.

Undernutrition-the leading risk factor for tuberculosis worldwide-is associated 
with impaired immunity, more extensive disease, delayed sputum conversion, and 
worse treatment outcomes, including mortality. In this Health Policy, we propose 
a comprehensive roadmap for integrating nutritional assessment, counselling, and 
support into tuberculosis treatment as part of person-centred care. At treatment 
initiation, we recommend standard nutritional assessment with anthropometric 
measurements and haemoglobin estimation, in addition to macronutrient and 
micronutrient support alongside nutritional counselling. Weight should be 
monitored during treatment and lack of weight gain at the end of the intensive 
phase should prompt an investigation of causes, such as food insecurity, poor 
treatment adherence, malabsorption, uncontrolled diabetes, or drug resistance. 
At the end of treatment, we recommend reassessing anthropometric measures to 
assess nutritional recovery. People with tuberculosis who remain underweight 
should receive close follow-up to detect early relapse. We call for annual 
reporting of nutritional metrics by WHO, explicit inclusion of nutritional 
assessment and care in national strategic plans, domestic or international 
support of nutritional programmes for people with tuberculosis, increased 
support for operational research initiatives, and integration of nutritional 
care into the WHO Multisectoral Accountability Framework at national and 
regional levels.

BACKGROUND: Outcomes of chronic Hepatitis B (CHB) infection have been 
increasingly associated with various metabolic syndromes, including 
metabolic-dysfunction associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), with a 
potential for impact on liver disease progression. There is some evidence that 
metformin, a widely used anti-diabetic drug, may reduce hepatocellular carcinoma 
(HCC) incidence in people living with Hepatitis B Virus (HBV), but with little 
to no evidence of impact on the virus itself in vivo. However, previous in vitro 
studies suggest metformin may have a direct impact on HBV replication, although 
the mechanism remains unclear.
OBJECTIVES: We aimed to investigate the impact of metformin on HBV replication 
in vitro.
STUDY DESIGN: Hepatocyte cell lines constitutively expressing HBV (HepAD38) were 
treated once or thrice with escalating doses of metformin, using lamivudine and 
water as controls. We monitored cellular cytotoxicity as well as HBV biomarkers 
(HBeAg, HBsAg, HBV DNA and RNA) throughout the assay.
RESULTS: We did not observe any impact of metformin on HBV replication after a 
single dose or three repeated treatments.
CONCLUSIONS: In HepAD38 cells, HBV replication is not impacted by metformin 
treatment. This contrasts with prior in vitro data but is in line with clinical 
evidence that suggests metformin acts through an influence on liver disease 
progression rather than a direct antiviral impact on HBV itself.

BACKGROUND: Obesity, characterized by excessive adipose tissue accumulation, has 
become a global health challenge with rapidly increasing prevalence. It 
contributes significantly to metabolic disorders including insulin resistance 
(IR). Renshen-zhuye decoction (RZD), a traditional Chinese medicine formula 
historically used for diabetes, shows potential for improving metabolic 
parameters, but its effects and mechanisms in obesity and insulin resistance 
remain unclear.
PURPOSE: This study aimed to evaluate the therapeutic benefits of RZD on obesity 
and insulin resistance, and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms through which 
it improves glucose and lipid metabolism.
METHODS: The role of RZD was evaluated in a high-fat diet (HFD) mouse model. The 
formula was characterized using UPLC-MS. Comprehensive analyses including 
histopathological staining, immunofluorescence, biochemical assays, 16S rRNA 
gene sequencing of gut microbiota, and non-targeted metabolomic analysis were 
performed. To validate the role of gut microbiota, we employed antibiotic 
treatment (ABX) to deplete intestinal flora and conducted fecal microbiota 
transplantation (FMT) experiments.
RESULTS: RZD treatment dose-dependently alleviated HFD-induced dyslipidemia and 
insulin resistance, improving glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity, and energy 
expenditure. Gut microbiota analysis revealed that RZD significantly modulated 
the composition of intestinal flora and their metabolic profiles. Additionally, 
RZD reduced intestinal and systemic inflammation by enhancing intestinal barrier 
integrity, particularly through increased expression of tight junction proteins 
such as Occludin. Importantly, the beneficial effects of RZD on weight 
management and glucose homeostasis were antagonized by antibiotic intervention, 
while FMT experiments confirmed that these improvements were mediated through 
gut microbiota modulation.
CONCLUSION: This study provides new insights into RZD's modulatory effects on 
gut microbiota and subsequent improvements in obesity-related metabolic 
parameters. RZD alleviates HFD-induced obesity and insulin resistance in mice by 
modulating gut microbiota composition and function, which subsequently improves 
intestinal barrier integrity, reduces inflammation, and enhances metabolic 
homeostasis.

BACKGROUND: Diabetic skin ulcer is a clinical disorder of glucose metabolism 
that has a long treatment period and is prone to recurrent episodes. Huiyang 
Shengji decoction (HYSJD) is an effective traditional Chinese medicine for its 
clinical treatment, but its metabolic effects in patients with diabetic skin 
ulcers have not been well studied.
PURPOSE: Our study aimed to investigate the mechanism of pharmacological 
treatment of HYSJD in treating diabetic skin ulcers.
METHODS: The potential mechanism underlying diabetic wound treatment by HYSJD 
was screened using network pharmacology. Ultra-high performance liquid 
chromatography-MS/MS metabolomics analysis and correlation analysis were 
performed to investigate potential target pathways and genes. Furthermore, the 
db/db diabetic wound tissues and RAW264.7 macrophage inflammation model verified 
the mechanism using molecular biology experiments.
RESULTS: In network pharmacology, HYSJD played a mainly therapeutic effect by 
regulating PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor 
resistance, metabolic pathway, and other related metabolic-related pathways. 
Metabolomics analysis disclosed that L-lysine content increased, while those of 
linoleic and deoxycholic acids decreased in plasma between the HYSJD-treated 
group and the control group, participating in biotin metabolism. Among them, 
PPARγ played an important role. The experiments conducted in db/db mice 
indicated that HYSJD facilitates VEGF secretion and PPARγ expression. In vitro 
experiments have revealed that HYSJD inhibits macrophage ROS production, 
augments mitochondrial ATP production, elevates mitochondrial membrane 
potential, and diminishes the mitochondrial ECAR rate. Furthermore, these 
effects culminate in promoting M2 macrophage polarization through PPARγ 
activation. The molecular docking results revealed that the active compounds 
from HYSJD were capable of binding to PPARγ protein primarily through hydrogen 
bonding interactions. Notably, all binding energies were found to be lower than 
-3 kcal/mol, indicating strong and favorable interactions between the active 
compounds and the target receptor.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggested that HYSJD regulates biotin metabolism by 
reducing excess levels of linoleic and deoxycholic acids and increasing levels 
of L-lysine, which in turn promotes diabetic wound healing by promoting M2 
macrophage polarization through PPARγ up-regulation. These findings indicated 
that HYSJD is a decoction that can effectively treat diabetic skin ulcers.

New wound dressings with therapeutic benefits are consistently being developed 
to enhance the wound healing process. In present study, a biocompatible wound 
dressing was fabricated using curcumin- incorporated poly glycerol sebacate/poly 
lactide acid (PGS/PLA) hydrogel to promote diabetic wound healing in rats. A 
total of 60 diabetic rats were randomly planned to four groups: the control 
group, PGS/PLA group, curcumin group, and PGS/PLA+Curcumin group. Sampling 
occurred on days 7 and 14 for further evaluations. Our findings revealed that 
the rates of wound healing, dimensions and thickness of newly created epidermis, 
counts of blood vessels, collagen accumulation, levels of TGF-β and VEGF 
cytokines, and wound robustness were notably greater in the treated groups 
versus the control group, with these effects being more significant in the 
PGS/PLA+Curcumin group. In contrast to the other groups, the PGS/PLA+Curcumin 
group exhibited a more significant reduction in the inflammatory and apoptotic 
cell counts, and concentration levels of IL-1β and TNF-α cytokines. In 
conclusion, it was established that the partnership of PGS/PLA and curcumin 
greatly improves healing of diabetic wounds.

PURPOSE: Distal symmetric polyneuropathy (DSP) is the most common diabetic 
neuropathy (75% of all diabetic neuropathies), potentially leading to plantar 
ulcers and lower limb amputation. Early detection of at-risk individuals is 
essential for timely intervention. This study aimed to evaluate different 
surface EMG (sEMG) parameters from isometric and dynamic exercises as biomarkers 
for early DSP detection and monitoring.
METHODS: The study involved 61 participants (34 controls and 27 cases with low, 
moderate and high levels of severity). sEMG signals were recorded from four 
lower-limb muscles (tibialis anterior, medial gastrocnemius, extensor digitorum 
brevis, and flexor digitorum brevis) and characterized by their amplitude, 
frequency, complexity and shape.
RESULTS: Significant sEMG differences were found between controls and diabetic 
patients at low and moderate/high DSP risk, especially in the extensor digitorum 
and flexor digitorum muscles during isometric and dynamic exercises. Diabetic 
patients showed lower amplitude and complexity, with higher frequency, 
peakedness, and asymmetry.
CONCLUSION: Parameters like root mean square, sample entropy, and central shape 
distance effectively distinguished between groups, highlighting changes in motor 
unit recruitment and muscle quality. Dynamic and isometric exercises emphasized 
their complementary roles in assessing muscle function, supporting sEMG's 
potential as a non-invasive tool for monitoring neuromuscular changes in 
diabetes.

OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effects of a high-glucose environment in type 2 
diabetes mellitus (T2DM) on Myocyte enhancer factor 2d (MEF2D) selective 
splicing and its impact on the disease process and mechanism.
METHODS: Human monocyte (THP-1) cells were induced into macrophages with phorbol 
12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), and treated with high glucose for 24 h. PCR 
confirmed MEF2D splicing products. MEF2D or MEF2D-AS overexpression vectors were 
transfected into macrophages, and ELISA detected inflammatory factors; flow 
cytometry analyzed MI/M2 phenotypes; and levels of LC3, PI3K, and LAMP2 were 
measured. Autophagic flux detection; co-immunoprecipitation detected MEF2D and 
KCNMA1 interaction; WB and RT-qPCR assessed KCNMA1 expression. Macrophages 
co-cultured with endothelial cells were analyzed by ELISA for vascular 
inflammation factors MMP-9, Cys-C, and hsCRP.
RESULTS: High glucose-induced alternative splicing of MEF2D at 86-132 aa. 
MEF2D-AS group showed higher inflammatory factors, increased M1 phenotype, lower 
autophagy gene expression, and higher vascular inflammation factors compared to 
MEF2D group. Autophagy activator Rapamycin or KCNMA1 overexpression reversed 
these effects. MEF2D targeted KCNMA1, and MEF2D-AS overexpression led to 
decreased KCNMA1, increased inflammatory factors, M1 polarization, autophagy 
inhibition, and higher vascular inflammation factors.
CONCLUSION: High glucose induces MEF2D alternative splicing in macrophages, 
inhibiting autophagy and promoting M1 polarization via KCNMA1 down-regulation, 
thus promoting chronic inflammation in T2DM vessels.

INTRODUCTION AND IMPORTANCE: Most common cases of Venous thromboembolism (VTE) 
seen for those who underwent for lower limb reconstruction and orthopedic trauma 
surgery in general. VTE was a rare surgical complication after shoulder 
replacement surgery. This study highlights that pulmonary embolism following 
upper extremity surgery increased in prevalence without currently guidelines for 
thromboembolism prevention during upper extremity surgeries especially shoulder 
arthroplasty surgeries.
CASE PRESENTATION: 80-year-old female patient presented at clinic with right 
shoulder pain. Clinical features and radiological investigations were suggestive 
of rotator cuff arthropathy. Following the diagnosis, the patient underwent 
right shoulder reverse arthroplasty. Two days post operation, the patient 
exhibited confusion and a decline in consciousness level also decrease in oxygen 
saturation levels. Clinical features and investigations pointed towards acute 
pulmonary embolism as the cause of the symptoms. Prompt intervention was 
initiated, and the patient was started on anticoagulant therapy to manage the 
condition. With appropriate management, the patient stabilized and was 
discharged from the hospital.
CLINICAL DISCUSSION: Diagnosis of PE need detailed history and physical 
examination including vital signs and modality of imaging like spiral Computed 
Tomography scan, risk factors for pulmonary embolism in patients who underwent 
shoulder arthroplasty were old age, prolonged surgery, female gender, obesity, 
diabetes, fluid and electrolyte imbalances, prolonged surgery and undergoing 
shoulder arthroplasty.
CONCLUSION: prophylactic anticoagulant therapy should be considered in patients 
with Risk factor for pulmonary embolism. There is a need to implement 
strategies, relevant guidelines, and policies to manage high-risk cases with a 
suspicion of thromboembolism post-shoulder arthroplasty.
